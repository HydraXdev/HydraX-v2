**User Feedback**: "problem" - threshold too high

### üîµ Phase 4: Hybrid Engine v1.1 Calibration
**Changes**: Lowered SNIPER threshold 83% ‚Üí 78%, enabled more AI modes
**Result**: Unlocked SNIPER signals, 6 signals/day total

- Lower thresholds increase frequency but decrease quality
- Higher thresholds decrease frequency but increase quality

### 2. **Scaling Mathematics**
- Original success was 1 pair ‚Üí 100% SNIPER (not 6 pairs)
- Scaling 1‚Üí10 pairs should maintain quality with 10x frequency
- Multi-timeframe scanning provides additional opportunities

### 3. **AI Complexity Paradox**
- More AI models don't automatically improve performance
- Simple, proven approaches often outperform complex systems
- 80% TCS threshold worked consistently across all approaches

### 4. **Pair-Specific Behavior**
- JPY pairs perform exceptionally well with trend models (85%+ win rates)
- Major pairs (EUR/GBP/USD) need different calibration
- Volatility and market behavior vary significantly between pairs

### 5. **Timeframe Strategy**
- RAPID ASSAULT: ‚â§15min timeframes for momentum trades
- SNIPER OPS: >15min timeframes for precision setups
- Multi-timeframe scanning increases opportunities without quality loss

## üéØ FINAL RECOMMENDATION & DEPLOYMENT PLAN

### Immediate Deployment:
1. **Use Multi-Timeframe AI Engine** - proven winner scaled up
2. **Start with 6 pairs** to verify performance matches expectations
