# ‚ö†Ô∏è ARCHIVED SIGNAL SYSTEMS - DO NOT USE

**Date**: August 3, 2025  
**Action**: Emergency archival of old/inactive signal systems  
**Reason**: Preventing confusion with current production systems  

## üö® ARCHIVED FILES (DO NOT USE)

These files have been archived because they are NOT part of current production:

### VENOM Systems (All Archived)
- `ARCHIVED_venom_scalp_master.py` - Old scalping system
- `ARCHIVED_apex_venom_v7_unfiltered.py` - Old VENOM v7 engine  
- `ARCHIVED_venom_real_data_engine.py` - Old real data engine
- `ARCHIVED_real_data_signal_generator.py` - Old signal generator

### APEX Systems (All Archived)
- All APEX mission files moved to `/ARCHIVED_MISSIONS/` (477 files)
- APEX engines and related files archived

## ‚úÖ CURRENT PRODUCTION SYSTEMS ONLY

**Only these systems are currently active:**

1. **ELITE_GUARD** (`elite_guard_with_citadel.py`) - PID 2183423
   - Smart Money Concepts detection
   - Currently generating LIQUIDITY_SWEEP_REVERSAL, ORDER_BLOCK_BOUNCE, FAIR_VALUE_GAP_FILL signals

2. **C.O.R.E. Crypto** (`src/bitten_core/crypto_fire_builder.py`)
   - Cryptocurrency signal execution for BTCUSD, ETHUSD, XRPUSD
   - Implemented August 3, 2025

3. **Black Box Truth Tracker** (`black_box_complete_truth_system.py`) - PID 2143042
   - Truth tracking for all signals

## üîí ARCHIVE PROTECTION

**DO NOT:**
- Reactivate any ARCHIVED_ files
- Reference old APEX or VENOM systems in documentation
- Assume any signal system is active without checking `ps aux`

**ALWAYS:**
- Check running processes to verify what's actually active
- Refer only to systems with confirmed PIDs
- Update documentation based on actual system state

**Next Agent**: Only reference systems that are actually running and verified active.
