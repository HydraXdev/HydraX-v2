# 🔗 v5.0 Telegram Integration

## ✅ Corrected Signal Flow Implementation

### Overview
v5.0 signals are now properly integrated with BITTEN's user-initiated trading flow via Telegram alerts and WebApp buttons.

### Signal Flow:
1. **v5.0 Engine** generates signals (35-95% TCS range)
2. **apex_telegram_connector.py** monitors logs
3. **Brief Telegram alerts** sent with WebApp button (2-3 lines)
4. **User clicks** "🎯 VIEW INTEL" to open WebApp
5. **WebApp displays** full mission briefing
6. **User decides** whether to execute trade
7. **Only approved trades** sent to MT5

### Files Created:
- `apex_telegram_connector.py` - Monitors logs and sends Telegram alerts

### How It Works:
```python
# Signal appears in log:
# 🎯 SIGNAL #1: EURUSD SELL TCS:76%

# Telegram alert sent:
⚡ **SIGNAL DETECTED**
EURUSD | SELL | 76% confidence
⏰ Expires in 10 minutes
[🎯 VIEW INTEL] <- WebApp button
```

### Running the Integration:
```bash
# 1. Start v5.0 (if not already running)
python3 apex_v5_integration.py
# Enter: _V5_LIVE

# 2. Start Telegram connector
python3 apex_telegram_connector.py

# The connector will:
# - Monitor logs for new signals
# - Send brief alerts to Telegram
# - Include WebApp buttons for full intel
```

### Key Features:
- **60-second cooldown** between identical signals
- **Urgency levels** based on TCS (CRITICAL: 85%+, HIGH: 70%+, MEDIUM: <70%)
- **WebApp integration** for full mission briefings
- **User control** maintained - no automatic execution

### WebApp URL:
- Production: https://joinbitten.com/hud
- Receives signal data via URL parameters
- Displays full mission briefing based on user tier

### Testing:
The connector is currently sending alerts to the admin user (7176191872) for testing.
In production, it would query the database for active subscribers and their tiers.

### Important Notes:
- This replaces the incorrect direct MT5 connection
- Maintains user control over trade execution
- Follows the documented BITTEN signal flow
- WebApp service must be running (port 8888)
