## 🔍 System Flow Analysis

### ✅ Working Correctly:
1. **Tier Access Control** - Proper signal viewing/execution limits
2. **XP System** - Earning and reset logic functional
3. **Signal Generation** - Creating signals at 87% threshold
4. **WebApp HUD** - Loading at https://joinbitten.com/hud
5. **Fire Mode Logic** - Selector properly restricted by tier
6. **Signal Classification** - RAPID/SNIPER working as designed

### 🚧 Blocking Issues:
1. **MT5 Connections** - No broker connections = no real trades
2. **Stripe Webhook** - No payment confirmation = manual tier updates
3. **Press Pass Limit** - 200/week not enforced
4. **Cron Jobs** - XP reset needs scheduling

### 🟡 Minor Issues:
1. **TCS Thresholds** - Hardcoded at 87%, needs admin panel
2. **Signal Frequency** - May need tuning based on 87% threshold
3. **Notification Timing** - All signals sent immediately (no batching)

---

## 📊 Simulation Summary

The core gameplay loop is **functional** but blocked by:
1. MT5 broker connections (critical)
2. Stripe payment webhook (important)
3. Cron job scheduling (important)

Once these are connected, the system should flow smoothly from signal generation through execution!
