## üé¨ Part 2: Cinematic Onboarding Experience

### Phase 1: First Contact (0-5 minutes)

#### Welcome Sequence
```
[User types /start]

üåô The screen fades in...

*A gentle chirp echoes in the darkness*

NORMAN (voice): "Hey there. Name's Norman. From Clarksdale, Mississippi. 
That chirp you heard? That's Bit. He's... well, he's why you're here."

[Bit's paw print appears] üêæ

NORMAN: "See, Bit and I discovered something. The market? It bites. 
Hard. Took everything from my dad. Almost took me too."

*Bit purrs softly*

NORMAN: "But we learned to bite back. And now... we're gonna teach you."

[Continue] ‚Üí
```

#### Bit Introduction
```
BIT PERSONALITY: *chirps excitedly* 

"This here's Bit - Born In Truck, if you're wondering. Found him 
in Dad's work truck during the worst storm Mississippi ever saw."

*Bit's amber eyes glow in the darkness*

"He's got this way of knowing things. When to wait. When to strike. 
When to run. Trust him. He's saved me more times than I can count."

[Bit nuzzles your hand virtually] üêæ

[Continue] ‚Üí
```

#### The Mission Briefing
```
DRILL PERSONALITY: "ALRIGHT RECRUIT! LISTEN UP!"

"You've been BITTEN. That means you're one of us now. 
A NODE in our network. A soldier in our war against the rigged system."

"Your first mission is simple: Learn. Survive. Grow."

"Norman built this system after the market nearly destroyed his family. 
Every feature, every voice, every protection - it's all here because 
someone bled for that lesson."

"ARE YOU READY TO BITE BACK?"

[‚úÖ YES, SIR!] [‚ùì Tell me more]
```

### Phase 2: First Trade Ceremony (10-15 minutes)

#### Interactive Tutorial
```
NEXUS: "Welcome to your first mission briefing, soldier! 
I'm NEXUS - think of me as your squad leader."

"See that signal coming in? That's not just numbers. 
That's opportunity. Let me break it down..."

[Interactive signal explanation with Bit's reactions]
- Symbol: EURUSD (Bit's ears perk up üê±)
- Direction: BUY (Bit stretches, ready to pounce)
- Confidence: 82% (Bit purrs approvingly)
- Risk: 2% (Grandmama's wisdom: "Never bet the farm")
```

#### Risk Visualization
```
DOC: "Hold up there, soldier. Before you fire, let me show you 
what we're really risking here."

[Visual: Your account as a Mississippi farmhouse]
"This is your capital. Your family's future. Every trade risks 
a piece of this farm."

[Visual: 2% highlighted]
"We only risk 2% - one small field. Even if the storm comes, 
the farm survives. That's how we outlast the market."

"Your Mama didn't sacrifice for you to gamble. We trade with 
discipline. Always."
```

#### Execution Ceremony
```
[User presses /fire]

*Time slows down*

BIT: *intense stare at the screen*

NORMAN: "This is it. Your first shot. Remember - the market's 
gonna try to bite. But you've got Bit. You've got us."

[Confirmation screen with pulsing button]

[EXECUTE TRADE - BITE BACK] 

*Button press triggers:*
- Bit's victory chirp
- Visual effects (Matrix-style data flow)
- Sound effects (keyboard click from Norman's setup)

"TRADE EXECUTED. YOU'RE OFFICIALLY A TRADER."
```

### Phase 3: First Result (Win or Loss)

#### If First Trade Wins:
```
DRILL: "OUTSTANDING! FIRST BLOOD DRAWN!"

*Bit does his victory stretch*

NORMAN: "See that? You just took your first bite outta the market. 
Feels good, don't it? But don't get cocky..."

[+50 XP] [Achievement Unlocked: FIRST BITE] üèÜ

ATHENA (preview): "A wise warrior celebrates briefly, 
then prepares for the next battle..."

[Continue Trading] [View Achievement]
```

#### If First Trade Loses:
```
*Bit nuzzles your hand comfortingly*

DOC: "Easy there, soldier. That sting you're feeling? That's the 
market's bite. We've all felt it."

NORMAN: "Lost my first trade too. And my second. Hell, lost my 
whole account once. But Bit stayed with me. And I learned."

"Every scar teaches. This one just taught you the market's real. 
Now let's learn to bite back smarter."
