This document contains every psychological trigger BITTEN is designed to activate across user onboarding, bot behavior, trade logic, tier access, and XP systems.

---

## 🧩 2. Identity Reinforcement
- Bots label behavior by tier: “That’s Apex behavior”
- Tier language shapes identity
- XP becomes a mirror of who the user *is*, not what they’ve done

---

## 🧠 3. Loss Aversion Conditioning
- Trade warning messages (“This will break your kill chain”)
- XP resets or denied access from bots

---

- Secret bot unlocks based on behavior
- RecruiterBot teases elite perks (blurred)

---

- Recruit-based FOMO language

---

## 🎮 6. Mission Control Loop
- Bots assign challenges (e.g. sniper drills, rejection tests)

- Failure has emotional consequence (“Mission expired”)
- Success triggers unlocks

---

## 🪞 7. Self-Confrontation Triggers

---

## 🔁 8. Ritual Formation

---

## 🧭 9. Uncertainty & Control Interplay

- Gemini = loss of control tension

---

## 🧨 10. Survivor’s Narrative

# 🔗 CONNECTION STRATEGIES

| Element        | What It Connects To              |
|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Bots           | Emotion (praise, shame, motivation, loyalty) |
| XP             | Identity + progression           |
| Lore           | Narrative immersion + belonging  |
| Commands       | Control + habit formation        |
| Trade results  | Feedback loop conditioning       |
| Tier system    | Status + aspiration              |
| Onboarding     | Transformation arc               |
| Delays         | Intrigue + emotional investment  |

## 🧠 HOW TO AVOID FAILURE

- Bots must never break immersion
- Language must always reinforce elite tone
- No spam or fake congrats — only earned praise
- Always preserve user choice (YES/NO, OFF/ON)
- Let XP, bot tone, and consequence shape behavior
