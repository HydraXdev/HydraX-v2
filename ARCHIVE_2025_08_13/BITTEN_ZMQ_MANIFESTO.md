# BITTEN ZMQ ENGINEERING BLUEPRINT & MANIFESTO

## üß† OVERVIEW

BITTEN is not a strategy bot. It is a **military-grade distributed trading control system** that uses MetaTrader 5 terminals as **execution drones**, not thinking machines. Each MT5 terminal is turned into a **portable tactical comms node**, directed entirely by central command logic (BITTEN Core), via ZMQ sockets.

The EA does not decide, calculate, or evaluate. It **listens, obeys, and confirms**.

## üîå SYSTEM DESIGN OVERVIEW

Each MT5 EA instance deployed under BITTEN architecture operates as a ZMQ-connected execution unit. This system is designed for horizontal deployment across hundreds or thousands of VPSs ‚Äî all communicating asynchronously and externally managed.

## üîÅ Data Flow Architecture

```
MT5 TERMINAL (PORTABLE MODE)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ZMQ PUSH ‚Üí Tickstream/telemetry ‚Üí BITTEN Core
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ZMQ PULL ‚Üê Fire commands (entry/sl/tp/lot)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ZMQ PUSH ‚Üí Execution confirmations ‚Üí Core logging/feedback
```

## üîë Core ZMQ Ports (default)

* **5556** ‚Üí Tick data PUSH
* **5555** ‚Üê Fire command PULL  
* **5558** ‚Üí Trade result PUSH

## ‚öôÔ∏è EA FUNCTIONAL ROLES

### ‚úÖ OnInit()
* Creates ZMQ context and sockets (`ZMQ_CONNECT` only ‚Äî never bind)
* Sends initial handshake packet:

```json
{
  "type": "handshake",
  "account": 843859,
  "broker": "Coinexx",
  "server": "Coinexx-Demo",
  "symbol": "BTCUSD",
  "balance": 10000.00,
  "equity": 9942.38,
  "timestamp": "2025-08-02T10:30:00Z"
}
```

* Displays chart message:
```
üéØ BITTEN ZMQ NODE: READY
```

### ‚úÖ OnTick()
* Streams current tick via `zmq_send()` as a JSON message
* Runs `zmq_recv(..., ZMQ_DONTWAIT)` to non-blockingly check for incoming fire mission
* If fire command is received:
   * Parses packet
   * Executes trade exactly as received (no local logic)
   * Sends confirmation packet:

```json
{
  "type": "executed",
  "symbol": "BTCUSD",
  "ticket": 12345678,
  "lot": 0.12,
  "price": 67302.00,
  "result": "success"
}
```

### ‚úÖ OnDeinit()
* Closes all sockets
* Destroys ZMQ context
* Sends optional disconnect message
* Clears chart comment

## üîí DOCTRINE: WHAT YOU MUST NEVER DO

BITTEN's ZMQ EA must not:
* ‚ùå Calculate lot size
* ‚ùå Bind sockets
* ‚ùå Use `while(true)` or `Sleep()`
* ‚ùå Use `WebRequest()` or `FileWrite()`
* ‚ùå Execute trades on its own
* ‚ùå Modify SL/TP/lot values
* ‚ùå Depend on profile paths or terminal state

This EA must:
* ‚úÖ Always use portable-mode MT5
* ‚úÖ Stay stateless between restarts
* ‚úÖ Function on unknown IPs with dynamic endpoints
* ‚úÖ Fail silently if ZMQ not connected, but never crash chart

## ‚ò£Ô∏è FINAL WARNING

**Do not modify this EA unless you understand the entire BITTEN system.**

This EA is not a bot. It is not designed to be smart. It is designed to be **obedient**, **modular**, and **invisible**.

All logic lives in BITTEN Core. This EA is simply the execution tip of the spear ‚Äî deployed blindly into potentially unstable environments with zero UI, zero context, and zero margin for error.

If you attempt to alter its behavior without understanding:
* Core timing
* Signal handling
* Risk control logic
* XP protocol dependencies

...you will break the battlefield comms layer.

And when that breaks ‚Äî the mission fails.

## ü™ñ Maintain discipline. Ask before altering. Only change with command approval.
