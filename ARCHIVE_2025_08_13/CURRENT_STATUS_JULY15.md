# BITTEN System Status Report
**Date**: July 15, 2025 07:00 UTC

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED WORK

### MT5 Bridge Connection Fixed
- **Issue**: Double backslash escaping in Windows paths prevented from detecting bridge files
- **Solution**: Fixed path escaping in `/root/HydraX-v2/apex_v5_live_real.py`
- **Result**: All symbols now detected, signals generating at TCS >= 65%

### Documentation Updated
- **CLAUDE.md**: Added comprehensive documentation of the fix
- **HANDOVER.md**: Updated to reflect resolved issues and remaining tasks

## üìä CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS

### ‚úÖ Working Components
1. **Engine**: Running and generating signals
   - Recent signals: GBPAUD BUY TCS:66%, EURAUD BUY TCS:66%
   - Bridge file detection: WORKING
   - TCS threshold: 65% (reduced from 5%)

2. **Telegram Connector**: Running and sending alerts
   - Last successful alert: GBPUSD at 16:18
   - Bot connected and operational

3. **TOC Server**: Central brain confirmed operational
   - Located at: `/root/HydraX-v2/src/toc/unified_toc_server.py`
   - Handles all signal routing and validation

4. **Nuclear WebApp**: Running on port 5000
   - Emergency backup operational
   - Process ID: 399892

5. **Signal Flow**: CONFIRMED WORKING
   - Bridge Files ‚Üí ‚Üí Telegram ‚Üí Users
   - User-driven execution model preserved

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Requiring Attention

1. **Main WebApp**: Service shows "active" but not accessible
   - Port 8080: Connection refused
   - https://joinbitten.com: Returns 502 Bad Gateway
   - Missing module: 'signal_storage' in webapp_server.py

2. **Telegram Alerts**: Need to verify end-user receipt
   - Connector is sending alerts
   - Need confirmation users are receiving them

## üéØ REMAINING TASKS

### Priority 1: WebApp Recovery
The main webapp needs attention:
- SystemD service is active but webapp not accessible
- Missing Python modules need installation
- Nuclear webapp providing backup but main webapp should be restored

### Priority 2: Telegram Alert Verification
- Monitor for new signals
- Confirm alerts reaching users
- Test complete flow from signal to execution

## üìù RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **WebApp Fix**: 
   - Install missing dependencies for webapp_server.py
   - Or switch to using src.bitten_core.web_app with proper dependencies
   - Verify correct port configuration

2. **System Monitoring**:
   - Continue monitoring logs for signals
   - Verify telegram delivery to actual users
   - Test fire button functionality once webapp is accessible

## üîß KEY ACHIEVEMENTS

1. **Bridge Connection**: RESOLVED - Path escaping fixed
2. **Signal Generation**: WORKING - Generating signals at proper TCS levels
3. **System Architecture**: CONFIRMED - TOC server is central brain
4. **Documentation**: UPDATED - CLAUDE.md and HANDOVER.md current

---

*Summary: MT5 bridge connection issue has been successfully resolved. is generating signals and Telegram connector is sending alerts. Main focus should now be on webapp accessibility and end-to-end flow verification.*
