# üéØ NIBBLER TACTICAL SYSTEM - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION

**Implementation Date**: July 20, 2025  
**Status**: FULLY CODED AND READY FOR DEPLOYMENT  
**Target Audience**: Broke people who need grocery money (grandma, mill workers, college kids)

---

## üéÆ **SYSTEM OVERVIEW**

**What We Built**: A complete shot-based tactical progression system that teaches real trading psychology through military-style signal execution rules.

**Core Insight**: Users don't understand "market analysis" - they just see "ATHENA: EURUSD LONG - TCS 78 - FIRE?" and decide whether to take the shot.

## üß† **PSYCHOLOGY & TEACHING**

### **What Users Learn (Without Realizing It):**

**Lone Wolf ‚Üí First Blood**: "I can be more strategic and make more money"
- **Teaches**: Momentum psychology, quality escalation

**First Blood ‚Üí Double Tap**: "I can make the same money with fewer trades"
- **Teaches**: Patience, signal quality assessment

**Double Tap ‚Üí Tactical Command**: "I've mastered all approaches, now I choose"
- **Teaches**: Complete tactical flexibility

### **Hidden Trading Education:**
- **Quality Assessment**: "Is 76 TCS good enough or should I wait for 85+?"
- **Opportunity Cost**: "Take this signal now or wait for better?"
- **Risk Escalation**: "I won the first trade, now I can risk more"
- **Profit Protection**: "I hit 2 wins, time to stop for the day"
- **Patience**: "I only get 2 shots, so they better be perfect"

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **SAFETY & CONSTRAINTS**

### **Hard Rules (Never Violated):**
```python
CONSTRAINTS = {
    "risk_per_trade": 2.0,          # Fixed 2% risk
    "max_daily_drawdown": 6.0,      # Hard 6% limit
    "max_concurrent_trades": 1,      # One at a time
    "max_shots_per_day": 6,         # Hard ceiling
    "signal_duration": "<1 hour",    # RAPID RAID only
    "max_rr_ratio": 2.0,            # NIBBLER limit
    "strategy_lock": "until_midnight" # No switching
}
```

### **Escalation Protection:**
- **Beginners start with 4 shots max** (not 6)
- **Lower R:R ratios** for learning (1:1.3 vs 1:2)
- **Stop conditions** prevent revenge trading
- **Daily resets** prevent compounding mistakes
