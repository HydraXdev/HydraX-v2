# Nibbler TCS Threshold Update Summary

## Overview
The TCS (Trading Confidence Score) threshold for the Nibbler tier has been lowered from 75% to 70% to allow more trading opportunities while maintaining safety standards.

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration File Updates

#### `/root/HydraX-v2/config/tier_settings.yml`
- **Nibbler tier**: `min_tcs` changed from 75 to 70
- **Bitmode configuration**: `tcs_min` changed from 75 to 70

### 2. Fire Mode Validator Updates

#### `/root/HydraX-v2/src/bitten_core/fire_mode_validator.py`
- Modified `_validate_semi_auto()` method to:
  - Allow Nibbler tier to use SEMI_AUTO mode with 70% TCS minimum
  - Maintain 75% TCS requirement for Commander and Apex tiers
  - Added specific validation logic for Nibbler tier

### 3. Signal Fusion Updates

#### `/root/HydraX-v2/src/bitten_core/signal_fusion.py`
- Updated `route_signal()` method in `TierBasedRouter` class to:
  - Allow Nibbler to receive RAPID tier signals with 70%+ confidence
  - Previously only allowed SNIPER and high PRECISION signals
  - Now includes RAPID signals meeting the 70% threshold

### 4. Fire Modes Configuration

#### `/root/HydraX-v2/src/bitten_core/fire_modes.py`
- No changes needed - already had `min_tcs=70` for Nibbler tier

## Impact

- **Nibbler users** can now:
  - Trade with signals that have 70% confidence or higher (down from 75%)
  - Receive RAPID tier signals that meet the 70% threshold
  - Use SEMI_AUTO fire mode with 70% TCS minimum

- **Other tiers** remain unchanged:
  - Fang: 85% TCS for sniper, 75% for arcade
  - Commander: 90% for auto, 75% for semi-auto
  - Apex: 91% TCS requirement
  - Press Pass: 60% TCS requirement

## Testing

A test script has been created at `/root/HydraX-v2/test_nibbler_tcs_simple.py` to verify all changes are working correctly.

## Safety Considerations

The 70% TCS threshold still maintains a high level of confidence while providing Nibbler users with more trading opportunities. All other safety mechanisms remain in place:
- Daily shot limits (6 for Nibbler)
- Risk management (2% default, 2.5% boost)
- Single position limit for Nibbler
- Drawdown cap (6% daily loss limit)
