# PRODUCTION FIRE ROUTER CONFIGURATION
# Generated: 2025-07-16 14:04:22.148864

## CRITICAL SAFETY MEASURES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Emergency Fallback DISABLED
- FireRouter has been patched to completely disable emergency fallback
- Local emergency bridge will NEVER be used for live trades
- This prevents users from losing money through simulation trades

### 2. AWS Bridge Configuration
- Production Bridge: 3.145.84.187:5555
- Enhanced MT5 Bridge: Deployed with socket functionality
- Live trades will ONLY execute through AWS bridge

### 3. Network Connectivity Status
- Current Status: No connectivity from this Linux server to AWS
- Possible Causes: Firewall, security groups, network routing
- Resolution: Manual intervention required on AWS/network side

### 4. Enhanced MT5 Bridge Features (Deployed)
- Socket listener on port 9000 (when accessible)
- Ping command: Returns MT5 account status
- Fire command: Executes real MT5 trades
- Console logging in required format
- Auto-reconnect MT5 functionality

## PRODUCTION SAFETY CHECKLIST

‚úÖ Emergency fallback disabled in FireRouter
‚úÖ Enhanced MT5 bridge code deployed to AWS
‚ùå Network connectivity to AWS bridge (manual fix needed)
‚ùå Socket functionality testing (depends on connectivity)

## WHEN AWS CONNECTIVITY IS RESTORED

1. Test enhanced bridge:
   python3 test_mt5_socket_bridge.py

2. Monitor bridge status:
   python3 aws_bridge_monitor.py

3. Verify production router:
   python3 configure_live_fire_router.py

## CRITICAL SAFETY NOTES

üö® NEVER re-enable emergency fallback for live trades
üö® ONLY use AWS bridge for real trade execution
üö® Local emergency bridge is for development/testing ONLY

Emergency fallback has been completely disabled to protect user accounts.
