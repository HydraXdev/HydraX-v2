# 🚀 Smart Press Pass Recycling System

## ✅ IMMEDIATE RECYCLING ON UPGRADE

### When User Upgrades:
```
User on Press Pass → Pays for NIBBLER → INSTANT ACTION:
1. Immediately assign REAL MT5 (Forex Demo)
2. Recycle Press Pass instance RIGHT NOW
3. Wipe that $50k demo mindset
4. Focus on quality with real broker
5. Press Pass slot available for next person
```

## ♻️ DAILY CLEANUP SWEEP (3 AM UTC)

### Every 24 Hours:
1. **Scan all Press Pass instances**
2. **Check last activity** (any of these = inactive):
   - No trades in 24 hours
   - No login in 24 hours  
   - No bot commands in 24 hours
3. **Recycle inactive ones immediately**
4. **Fresh inventory every morning**

### Benefits:
- If 180 people tried yesterday and 150 quit → 150 slots back
- If only 5 signed up yesterday → 195 slots available
- **DYNAMIC CAPACITY** based on real usage

## 🔥 FOMO MECHANICS

### Landing Page Display:
```html
🚨 PRESS PASS SLOTS TODAY 🚨
[████████░░] 47/200 REMAINING

⏰ Resets in: 4h 23m
```

### When All 200 Taken:
```html
❌ TODAY'S PRESS PASSES: SOLD OUT

🔔 JOIN WAITING LIST 🔔
Be first when slots open at 3 AM UTC\!
[Email: ___________] [NOTIFY ME]

"Yesterday 73 people missed out. Don't let it be you."
```

## 📊 Dynamic Slot Management

### Real Examples:

**Monday**: Viral TikTok video
- 200 slots gone by noon
- 156 people on waitlist
- Email blast at 3 AM: "Your slot is ready\!"

**Tuesday**: Normal day
- 45 signups all day
- 155 slots available
- No scarcity = less urgency

**Wednesday**: Create scarcity
- Show "Only 37 slots left\!" (even if 155 available)
- Drives FOMO
- Conversion rate jumps

## 🎯 Smart Recycling Rules

### Immediate Recycle Triggers:
1. **User upgrades** → Instant recycle
2. **User uninstalls Telegram bot** → Instant recycle
3. **Blocked bot** → Instant recycle
4. **24h no activity** → Daily sweep recycle

### Keep Active If:
- Made a trade in last 24h
- Opened bot in last 24h
- Has open positions
- Actively learning (viewing education)

## 💡 Psychological Tricks

### Slot Counter Manipulation:
```python
def get_display_slots():
    actual_available = 147
    
    if actual_available > 100:
        # Create false scarcity
        return random.randint(15, 45)
    elif actual_available > 50:
        # Show momentum
        return actual_available - 20
    else:
        # Real scarcity
        return actual_available
```

### Waitlist Psychology:
- "32 people ahead of you"
- "Estimated wait: 2-4 hours"
- "🎉 YOU'RE NEXT\! Check email"
- Creates anticipation and value

## 📈 Conversion Optimization

### Why This Works:
1. **Upgrade = Instant gratification** (new MT5 immediately)
2. **No artificial limits** (use all 200 if needed)
3. **FOMO drives signups** ("only 23 left\!")
4. **Waitlist captures overflow** (don't lose anyone)
5. **Daily reset** = fresh urgency every day

### Expected Results:
- **Signup rate**: +200% on "low slot" days
- **Upgrade rate**: +40% (immediate MT5 swap)
- **Waitlist conversion**: 65% claim slot when notified
- **Optimal usage**: 120-180 daily (keeps scarcity real)
