## üéØ Performance Baselines Established

### **Target Performance Metrics**
Based on Elite Guard v6.0 specifications and system capabilities:

**Signal Generation Targets**:
- Expected: 20-30 signals/day during active sessions (London/NY overlap)
- Current: 2.7/hour during ASIAN (acceptable for off-peak)
- Peak Performance: 3-4 signals/hour during OVERLAP sessions

**Signal Quality Targets**:
- Win Rate Target: 60-70% (Elite Guard specification)  
- Current: Cannot measure (delivery pipeline broken)
- Confidence Range: 65%+ (current system delivering 75-83%)

**System Performance Targets**:
- Service Uptime: 99.5% (current: 100%)
- Signal Delivery: 95%+ (current: 0% - CRITICAL ISSUE)
- User Execution Rate: 15-25% of delivered signals
- Response Time: <2 seconds for /fire commands

### **Resource Utilization Baselines**
- **Memory**: 32% baseline (1.2Gi/3.8Gi) - healthy headroom
- **Disk**: 83% baseline (64G/78G) - needs monitoring
- **CPU**: Low baseline during ASIAN session
- **Network**: ZMQ architecture performing well (all ports active)

## üö® Critical Issues Identified

### **Priority 1: Signal Delivery Pipeline Broken**
- **Problem**: 131 signals generated, 0 delivered to users
- **Root Cause**: Elite Guard ‚Üí WebApp signal flow interruption
- **Impact**: Complete user experience failure
- **Fix Required**: Restore Elite Guard ZMQ relay to WebApp integration

### **Priority 2: User Execution System Inactive**
- **Problem**: No /fire commands processed (0 executions)
- **Dependency**: Requires Priority 1 fix first
- **Impact**: No live trading capability
- **Baseline**: Should process 15-25% of delivered signals

### **Priority 3: Signal Completion Tracking**
- **Problem**: No signals reaching SL/TP completion
- **Dependency**: Requires Priority 1 & 2 fixes
- **Impact**: Cannot measure win/loss performance
- **Baseline**: Should complete 80-90% of executed signals

## üìà Performance Benchmarks

### **Healthy System Metrics** (Targets)
```
Signal Generation:    20-30/day (London/NY sessions)
Delivery Rate:        95%+ to users
User Execution Rate:  15-25% of delivered signals  
Win Rate:            60-70% (Elite Guard specification)
Completion Rate:     80-90% of executed signals
Service Uptime:      99.5%
Response Time:       <2 seconds (/fire commands)
```

### **Current System State** (Baseline)
```
Signal Generation:    ‚úÖ 2.7/hour (ASIAN session baseline)
Delivery Rate:        ‚ùå 0% (BROKEN - critical fix needed)
User Execution Rate:  ‚ùå 0% (depends on delivery fix)
Win Rate:            ‚ùå N/A (no completed signals)
Completion Rate:     ‚ùå 0% (no executions)

- **Resource Usage**: Memory and disk utilization tracking
- **Performance Degradation**: Win rate and delivery rate monitoring

## üí° Recommendations

### **Immediate Actions Required**
1. **Fix Signal Delivery Pipeline**: Restore Elite Guard ‚Üí WebApp signal flow
2. **Test User Execution**: Verify /fire command processing after delivery fix
3. **Monitor Signal Completion**: Track SL/TP outcomes once executions start
4. **Disk Space Management**: 83% usage requires cleanup or expansion

### **Performance Optimization**
1. **Session Optimization**: Increase signal generation during London/NY overlap
2. **Quality Filtering**: Maintain 65%+ confidence threshold for user delivery
3. **Resource Monitoring**: Set up alerts for memory >80% and disk >90%
4. **Response Time**: Optimize /fire command processing for <2 second response
