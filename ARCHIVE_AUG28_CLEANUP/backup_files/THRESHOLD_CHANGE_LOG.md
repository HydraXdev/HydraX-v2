# Elite Guard Threshold Change Log

## August 1, 2025 - 15:13 UTC

**Change**: Lowered Elite Guard confidence threshold from 65% to 50%
**Duration**: 5 hours (until ~20:13 UTC)
**Purpose**: Live-fire benchmarking and truth system analysis
**Requestor**: User directive for weak signal analysis

### Expected Impact:
- More signals will pass through (including borderline quality)
- All signals tracked by truth system for outcome analysis
- CITADEL Shield will still score and classify all signals
- Provides full pipeline benchmarking data

### To Restore:
Edit line 611 in elite_guard_with_citadel.py:
```python
# Change from:
quality_patterns = [p for p in patterns if p.final_score >= 50]
# Back to:
quality_patterns = [p for p in patterns if p.final_score >= 65]
```

Then restart Elite Guard.

**Note**: This is a TEMPORARY change for testing purposes only.
