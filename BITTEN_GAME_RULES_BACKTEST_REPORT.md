### **Key Insights:**

#### **NIBBLER Performance (85.0% win rate):**
‚úÖ **Excellent performance** - exceeds expectations  
‚úÖ Higher win rate than premium tiers (unexpected finding)  
‚úÖ Daily limit working correctly (6 shots/day)  
‚úÖ 70% TCS threshold providing quality signals  

#### **FANG Performance (68.2% win rate):**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Underperforming** - below NIBBLER despite 85% TCS requirement  
‚ö†Ô∏è Suggests TCS threshold too aggressive or signal quality issue  
‚ö†Ô∏è May need adjustment to improve value proposition  

#### **COMMANDER Performance (77.3% win rate):**
‚úÖ **Good performance** - meets expectations  
‚úÖ Dual-threshold system working (85% manual, 91% auto)  
‚úÖ Daily limit working correctly (12 shots/day)  

#### **APEX Performance (50.0% win rate):**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Low volume** - only 4 trades executed  
‚ö†Ô∏è 91% TCS requirement very restrictive  
‚ÑπÔ∏è Expected behavior for premium tier with highest standards
