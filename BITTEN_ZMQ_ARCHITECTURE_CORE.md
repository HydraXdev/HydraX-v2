# üß† BITTEN ZMQ ARCHITECTURE - CORE SYSTEM PRINCIPLES

**CRITICAL**: This document defines the fundamental architecture of BITTEN. All agents and developers MUST understand and follow these principles.

**Created**: August 1, 2025  
**Priority**: MANDATORY READING  
**Status**: PERMANENT ARCHITECTURE DEFINITION

## üéØ CORE DESIGN REALITY: BITTEN Is Not a Script ‚Äî It's a Live Execution Platform

### What Makes BITTEN Different

**Most trading bots are:**
- Single-process applications
- File-based or HTTP-triggered
- EA-only with no external logic
- Simple signal ‚Üí execution flows

**BITTEN is:**
- A multi-service, event-driven trading OS
- Powered by ZMQ sockets, not APIs or files
- A complete platform including:
  - Signal generation (VENOM)
  - Tactical filtering (CITADEL)
  - Real-time bridge control (fire_router)
  - XP/risk scoring systems
  - MT5 trade execution
  - Live telemetry and feedback loops

---

## üîÅ ZMQ Is the System's Nervous System

**CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING**: ZMQ is not a plugin or optional component ‚Äî it is the core communication protocol of the entire platform.

### Architecture Facts:
- EA connects **directly** to ZMQ sockets from MT5 using libzmq.dll
- All fire commands flow through ZMQ sockets
- All telemetry streams through ZMQ sockets
- All execution feedback returns via ZMQ sockets
- There is **NO** file fallback long-term
- There is **NO** HTTP signal dispatch
- There is **NO** API middleware layer

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Mental Model You MUST Adopt

```
[ EA on VPS ] ‚Üê‚Üí [ ZMQ Controller ] ‚Üê‚Üí [ Signal Engine + XP + Fire Router ]
     ‚Üì                    ‚Üì                           ‚Üì
libzmq.dll          Port 5555/5556              VENOM + CITADEL
Direct Socket       Command/Telemetry            Real-time Logic
```

### Key Points:
- ZMQ replaces ALL file and HTTP logic
- Every trade is initiated over socket
- Every account update is streamed via socket
- Every confirmation is acknowledged via socket
- The EA maintains persistent socket connections

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes to AVOID

1. **DO NOT** assume ForexVPS needs an API middleware ‚Äî the EA uses libzmq.dll to connect directly
2. **DO NOT** treat the EA like a webhook or REST client ‚Äî it's a persistent socket listener
3. **DO NOT** remove any socket daemon or think ZMQ is optional ‚Äî it's not
4. **DO NOT** implement file-based fallbacks without explicit authorization
5. **DO NOT** route signals through HTTP endpoints
6. **DO NOT** treat ZMQ as a temporary migration step

---

## ‚úÖ Development Principles Going Forward

### 1. Core Infrastructure to ALWAYS Preserve:
- `fire_router.py` - Must use ZMQ as primary execution
- `zmq_fire_publisher_daemon.py` - Command channel daemon
- `zmq_telemetry_daemon.py` - Telemetry receiver daemon
- `zmq_bitten_controller.py` - Core 3-way controller
- EA v7 (ZMQ-enabled) - Never downgrade to file-based EAs

### 2. All New Features Must:
- Assume ZMQ as the primary transport layer
- Never bypass the socket infrastructure
- Integrate with existing telemetry streams
- Respect the real-time, event-driven nature

### 3. System Priorities:
- Real-time socket routing
- Telemetry parsing and analysis
- XP-triggered feedback loops
- Persistent connection management
- Zero-latency execution paths

## üèóÔ∏è Current Live Implementation

As of August 1, 2025, the system is LIVE with:

### Active Components:
- **ZMQ Controller**: Running on 134.199.204.67:5555/5556
- **EA v7**: Connected from ForexVPS, sending telemetry
- **Telemetry Stream**: Balance: $3000.00, active_users: 1
- **Firewall**: Ports 5555/5556 open for EA connections

### Verified Working:
```
‚úÖ EA Connection: Status: reconnected
‚úÖ Telemetry Flow: Every 5 seconds
‚úÖ Command Channel: Port 5555 ready
‚úÖ Feedback Channel: Port 5556 streaming
‚úÖ Active Users: 1 (EA connected)
```

## üö® PERMANENT MANDATE

**BITTEN is a platform, not a product. ZMQ is not a feature ‚Äî it's the bloodstream.**

Every line of code, every system decision, every architecture choice must respect this fundamental truth. The socket infrastructure IS the system. Without it, BITTEN doesn't exist.

### This Architecture is NON-NEGOTIABLE

Any attempt to bypass, remove, or deprecate the ZMQ infrastructure is a fundamental misunderstanding of what BITTEN is. File-based execution was the past. HTTP APIs are not the future. ZMQ sockets ARE the system.

## üìå For All Future Agents

**MEMORIZE THIS**: This document is your architecture anchor point for BITTEN. All future modules must assume this model unless explicitly overridden by system owner with written justification.

When in doubt:
1. Check if your solution uses ZMQ sockets
2. If not, redesign it to use ZMQ sockets
3. There is no step 3

**Build accordingly.**
