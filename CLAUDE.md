## 💰 TIER SYSTEM (UNIFIED RISK MANAGEMENT)

### All Tiers Use Dynamic 2% Risk
- **PRESS PASS**: 2% max risk, demo accounts
- **NIBBLER**: 2% max risk, real money, 1 concurrent trade  
- **FANG**: 2% max risk, real money, 2 concurrent trades

## 🔧 CLONE FARM OPERATIONS

### Wine Docker Architecture (Speed & Control)
```bash
# Docker-based Wine MT5 containers for lightning-fast scaling
docker run -d --name wine_mt5_master \
  -v /root/mt5_shared:/mt5_shared \
  -v /root/wine_master:/root/.wine \
  --network clone_farm_network \
  wine:mt5-optimized

# User clone creation (sub-second deployment)
docker run -d --name wine_user_${USER_ID} \
  -v /root/mt5_shared:/mt5_shared \
  -v /root/wine_user_${USER_ID}:/root/.wine \
  --network clone_farm_network \
  --cpus="0.25" --memory="512m" \
  wine:mt5-optimized
```

### Docker Clone Benefits
- **Lightning Speed**: Sub-second user clone deployment
- **Resource Control**: CPU/memory limits per user
- **Network Isolation**: Secure inter-clone communication
- **Volume Sharing**: Efficient MT5 binary sharing
- **Auto-Scaling**: Kubernetes-ready for 5K+ users
- **Update Blocking**: Containerized MT5 versions frozen

### Master Clone Management
```bash
# Master clone validation
python3 master_clone_test.py

# Create user clone from master  
python3 clone_user_from_master.py

# Docker-based user clone (NEW)
python3 docker_clone_user.py --user_id=${USER_ID} --broker=coinexx

# Test real account integration
python3 test_real_account_integration.py
```

### User Clone Scaling (Docker-Enhanced)
1. **Master Container** - Wine/MT5 base image proven and frozen
2. **Clone Creation** - Docker containers from master image
3. **Credential Injection** - User broker details via environment variables
4. **Resource Isolation** - CPU/memory limits per user container
5. **Real Execution** - Direct to user's broker account via container API

### Farm Monitoring
- **Docker Health Checks**: Container status monitoring
- **Resource Monitoring**: CPU/memory usage per user
- **Network Monitoring**: Inter-container communication
- **Auto-Restart**: Failed containers automatically recovered
- **Scaling Metrics**: Real-time user load balancing
- **Update Blocking**: MT5 auto-updates prevented via Docker layer
