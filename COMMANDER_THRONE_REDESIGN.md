# Commander Throne Dashboard Redesign - Complete Overhaul

## Overview
The Commander Throne dashboard has been completely redesigned to provide command-at-a-glance visibility of all critical metrics, with a focus on revenue, user analytics, and system performance.

- **Tier Breakdown**: Visual grid showing subscriber count and revenue by tier
  - NIBBLER ($39): Green
  - FANG ($89): Orange  
  - COMMANDER ($139): Deep Orange
  - APEX ($188): Red

#### System Status (Center-Left)
- **Bridge Status**: Real-time MT5 bridge connection status
- **APEX Status**: Signal engine online/offline status
- **Signals/Hour**: Current signal generation rate

#### Performance Metrics (Center-Right)
- **Win Rate**: Actual executed trade win rate
- **True Win Rate**: Including ghosted trades (shows system potential)
