## 🚀 Quick Integration Steps

### Step 1: Bot Integration

Add to your main bot file (`bitten_production_bot.py`):

```python
from src.bitten_core.credit_referral_bot_commands import get_credit_referral_bot_commands

# Initialize
credit_commands = get_credit_referral_bot_commands()

# Add command handlers
@bot.message_handler(commands=['recruit'])
async def handle_recruit(message):
    await credit_commands.handle_recruit_command(message, None)

@bot.message_handler(commands=['credits'])
async def handle_credits(message):
    await credit_commands.handle_credits_command(message, None)

@bot.callback_query_handler(func=lambda call: True)
async def handle_callback(call):
    await credit_commands.handle_callback_query(call, None)
```

### Step 2: Webapp Integration

Add to your Flask app (`webapp_server_optimized.py`):

```python
from src.bitten_core.credit_admin_api import register_credit_admin_blueprint

# Register admin endpoints
register_credit_admin_blueprint(app)
```

### Step 3: Stripe Configuration

Ensure these webhooks are configured in Stripe:

- `invoice.created`
- `payment_intent.succeeded`
- Customer metadata includes `user_id` or `telegram_id`

### Step 4: Database Setup

The system auto-creates its database on first use:

- Location: `/root/HydraX-v2/data/credit_referrals.db`
- Tables: `referral_codes`, `referral_credits`, `user_credit_balances`, `gamification_rewards`

---
