# BITTEN Dual Mode Performance Monitoring System

## Overview
Enhanced performance monitoring system that tracks RAPID ASSAULT vs PRECISION STRIKE signals separately for detailed analysis and optimization.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Enhanced Signal Outcome Monitor (`signal_outcome_monitor.py`)
**Enhancements Added:**
- **Dual Mode Tracking**: Separate statistics for RAPID vs SNIPER signals
- **Time-to-TP Tracking**: Records actual time from signal generation to TP hit
- **R:R Achievement**: Calculates actual risk/reward ratios achieved vs expected
- **Mode-Specific Statistics**: Win rates, confidence levels, and performance metrics per mode

**New Features:**
- `update_dual_mode_stats()` - Updates separate stats for each signal mode
- `get_dual_mode_performance()` - Calculates real-time performance metrics
- `save_dual_mode_stats()` - Persists statistics to dual_mode_stats.jsonl
- Enhanced statistics display showing RAPID vs SNIPER breakdown

### 2. Dual Mode Dashboard (`dual_mode_dashboard.py`) 
**New Real-Time Dashboard Features:**
- **Live Signal Status**: Shows active signals and generation frequency
- **Mode Comparison**: Side-by-side RAPID vs SNIPER performance
- **Recent Activity**: Last 5 signal outcomes with timing and pips
- **Performance Metrics**: Win rates, time-to-TP, R:R ratios per mode
- **Auto-Refresh**: Updates every 5 seconds with live data

### 3. Enhanced Truth Log Tracking (`clean_truth_writer.py`)
**New Fields Added:**
- `signal_mode` - Tracks RAPID_ASSAULT vs PRECISION_STRIKE
- `estimated_time_to_tp` - Predicted time to TP based on signal mode
- `actual_time_to_tp` - Filled when signal completes (for analysis)
- `achieved_rr_ratio` - Actual R:R achieved (calculated on completion)

### 4. Startup Script (`start_dual_mode_monitoring.sh`)
Easy-to-use script that starts both the enhanced monitor and dashboard together.

## Data Files

### dual_mode_stats.jsonl
Real-time statistics for both signal modes:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-19T16:52:38",
  "rapid_stats": {
    "signals_completed": 9,
    "wins": 6, 
    "losses": 3,
    "win_rate": 66.7,
    "avg_time_to_tp": 1,
    "avg_rr_achieved": 1.72,
    "avg_confidence": 93.8
  },
  "sniper_stats": { ... }
}
```

## Usage

### Start Complete Monitoring System:
```bash
./start_dual_mode_monitoring.sh
```

### Run Dashboard Only:
```bash
python3 dual_mode_dashboard.py
```

### Run Enhanced Monitor Only:
```bash
python3 signal_outcome_monitor.py
```

## Live Performance Data (as of testing)

**üèÉ RAPID ASSAULT MODE:**
- Win Rate: 66.7% (6W/3L) 
- Average Time to TP: 1-4 seconds
- Average R:R Achieved: 1.72
- Average Confidence: 93.8%

**üéØ PRECISION STRIKE MODE:**
- Currently no completed signals (all recent signals were RAPID mode)
- System ready to track when PRECISION STRIKE signals are generated

## Key Benefits

1. **Mode-Specific Optimization**: Identify which signal mode performs better
2. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live dashboard shows current performance
3. **Time Analysis**: Track how quickly signals reach targets
4. **R:R Validation**: Verify actual vs expected risk/reward ratios
5. **Production Ready**: Runs alongside existing BITTEN system without interference

## Integration with Existing System

The enhanced monitoring system:
- ‚úÖ Preserves all existing functionality
- ‚úÖ Adds dual mode tracking without breaking current processes
- ‚úÖ Works with current Elite Guard signal generation
- ‚úÖ Compatible with existing truth_log.jsonl format
- ‚úÖ Runs independently and can be stopped/started without affecting trading

## Next Steps

1. Monitor system during active trading sessions
2. Collect data on both RAPID and SNIPER signal performance
3. Use performance data to optimize signal generation parameters
4. Consider adjusting confidence thresholds based on mode-specific win rates
