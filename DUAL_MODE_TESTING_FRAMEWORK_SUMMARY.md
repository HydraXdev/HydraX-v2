---

## 🎯 Package Overview

This testing framework provides complete validation for the BITTEN dual-mode signal system, specifically testing:

### New Momentum Patterns (RAPID Mode)

1. **momentum_burst** - 3+ consecutive M1 candles in same direction
2. **session_open_fade** - 10+ pip spike in first 5 minutes, fade back
3. **micro_breakout_retest** - Break key level, pullback, successful hold

### Signal Classification System

- **RAPID Mode:** Quick scalping patterns (4-7 pip TP, 1.2:1 R:R minimum)
- **SNIPER Mode:** Precision reversal patterns (18-30 pip TP, 2.0:1 R:R minimum)
- **Auto-Classification:** Pattern type determines mode assignment

### Advanced Validation Features

- TP/SL calculation accuracy testing
- Risk-reward ratio compliance verification
- Confidence threshold filtering validation
- Session-based adjustment testing
- Backward compatibility assurance
- Shadow mode parallel testing
- Expected win rate validation

## 🚨 Failure Analysis & Recovery

### Critical Failure Categories

1. **Initialization Failures** → Elite Guard setup issues
2. **Pattern Detection Failures** → New method implementation problems
3. **Classification Failures** → RAPID/SNIPER logic errors
4. **Calculation Failures** → TP/SL mathematical errors
5. **Compatibility Failures** → Legacy system integration breaks

### Debugging Tools Included

```bash
# Quick system verification
python3 -c "from elite_guard_with_citadel import EliteGuardWithCitadel; eg = EliteGuardWithCitadel(); print(f'Dual Mode: {eg.DUAL_MODE_ENABLED}')"

# Pattern method verification
python3 -c "from elite_guard_with_citadel import EliteGuardWithCitadel; eg = EliteGuardWithCitadel(); print([m for m in dir(eg) if 'momentum_burst' in m])"

# Classification testing
python3 -c "from elite_guard_with_citadel import EliteGuardWithCitadel; eg = EliteGuardWithCitadel(); print(eg.classify_signal_mode('MOMENTUM_BURST', 5))"
```

### Recovery Procedures

1. **Analyze failure report** - Check dual_mode_test_report.json
2. **Identify root causes** - Use error messages and stack traces
3. **Fix critical issues first** - Prioritize core functionality
4. **Re-run tests iteratively** - Validate each fix immediately
5. **Achieve green light status** - All critical tests must pass
