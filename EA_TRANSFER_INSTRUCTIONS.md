# üì• Getting the EA to Windows AWS Server

## Current Situation:
- ‚úÖ EA file is on Linux server
- ‚ùå Cannot transfer directly due to size/encoding issues
- ‚ùå Webapp static file serving not working for .mq5 files

## üîß Manual Options to Get EA to Windows:

### Option 1: AWS Systems Manager (Recommended)
1. Open AWS Console
2. Go to Systems Manager ‚Üí Session Manager
3. Start session with your Windows instance
4. Run in PowerShell:
```powershell
# Create directory
mkdir C:\MT5_Farm\

# Option A: If you have access to a file sharing service
# Upload EA there and download

# Option B: Use certutil to decode from base64
# (Would need to encode EA first and paste)
```

### Option 2: RDP File Transfer
1. Connect via RDP to Windows server
2. Copy file from your local machine
3. Paste into C:\MT5_Farm\

### Option 3: S3 Bucket (If configured)
1. Upload EA to S3 bucket
2. Download on Windows:
```powershell
aws s3 cp s3://your-bucket/BITTENBridge_v3_ENHANCED.mq5 C:\MT5_Farm\
```

### Option 4: GitHub
1. I could commit the EA to your repo
2. Download from GitHub on Windows:
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/main/EA/BITTENBridge_v3_ENHANCED.mq5" -OutFile "C:\MT5_Farm\EA.mq5"
```

## üìã Once EA is on Windows:

### Deploy to all 5 masters:
```powershell
# Copy EA to all master directories
$masters = @("Generic_Demo", "Forex_Demo", "Forex_Live", "Coinexx_Demo", "Coinexx_Live")

foreach ($master in $masters) {
    $target = "C:\MT5_Farm\Masters\$master\MQL5\Experts\BITTENBridge_v3_ENHANCED.mq5"
    
    # Create directory if needed
    $dir = Split-Path $target -Parent
    if (\!(Test-Path $dir)) {
        New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $dir -Force
    }
    
    # Copy EA
    Copy-Item "C:\MT5_Farm\BITTENBridge_v3_ENHANCED.mq5" $target -Force
    Write-Host "Copied to $master"
}
```

## ‚ùì Why Can't I Transfer It?

1. **File size**: 29,942 bytes is too large for command encoding
2. **Special characters**: MQL5 code has characters that break shell encoding
3. **HTTP limitations**: Agent has size limits on commands
4. **Webapp issue**: Static file serving not configured for .mq5 extension

The most reliable way is manual transfer via RDP or AWS Session Manager.
