ðŸš¨ FAKE ENGINES DISABLED - DO NOT RE-ENABLE

Date: July 28, 2025
Action: Disabled fake signal generators with synthetic data

FILES DISABLED:
- apex_venom_v7_unfiltered.py.FAKE_DISABLED (was generating 100% fake signals)
- working_signal_generator.py.FAKE_DISABLED (was using fake VENOM engine)

ISSUES WITH FAKE ENGINES:
- Random number generators for market regime detection  
- Hardcoded fake spread/volume data
- Artificial 99% confidence inflation
- Fixed BUY direction with no real analysis
- Completely ignored real MT5 tick data

REPLACEMENT:
âœ… REAL ENGINE: real_data_signal_generator.py
âœ… USES: 100% authentic MT5 tick data
âœ… FEATURES: Real technical analysis, proper confidence scoring

DO NOT rename these files back to .py - they contain synthetic data generation!
Use only the real data engine: ./start_real_signal_generator.sh
