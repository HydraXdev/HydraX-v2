### 🎯 NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

1. **Complete Stripe Integration**
   - Add real API keys to .env
   - Test webhook endpoint
   - Verify subscription creation

2. **MT5 Bridge Completion**
   - Parse trade results
   - Send confirmations to Telegram
   - Implement emergency stop

3. **User Onboarding**
   - Connect /start command
   - Build MT5 walkthrough
   - Create first trade flow

### 📝 IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Stripe Key Issue**: User provided restricted key (rk_live) instead of secret key (sk_live). Need secret key for API calls.

2. **Cloudflare 502 Error**: Was caused by SSL/TLS setting. Needs to be "Flexible" mode since server has no SSL certificate.

3. **Landing Page**: Fully functional at IP address. Domain will work once Cloudflare is configured correctly.

4. **Bot Integration**: Landing page buttons link to @Bitten_Commander_bot on Telegram.

5. **Monthly Only**: Removed all annual billing code per user request to reduce complexity.

### 💻 QUICK COMMANDS FOR NEXT SESSION

```bash
# Check services
systemctl status bitten-web nginx

# View logs
journalctl -u bitten-web -f

# Edit environment variables
nano /root/HydraX-v2/.env

# Restart web service
systemctl restart bitten-web

# Test webhook locally
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/stripe/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"test"}'
```

### 🔒 SECURITY REMINDERS

1. Change FLASK_SECRET_KEY in .env to random value
2. Install SSL certificate when ready for production
3. Keep Stripe keys secure and never commit to git
4. Monitor webhook logs for suspicious activity

**Session Duration**: ~2 hours
**Main Achievement**: Complete landing page and Stripe foundation
**Blocker**: Need real Stripe API keys to proceed
**User Feedback**: "looks awesome"

### ⚠️ GIT PUSH BLOCKED
GitHub is blocking the push due to the Stripe API key in commit history. 
To fix in next session:
1. Visit the URL in the error message to allow the push, OR
2. Remove the commit from history with: `git reset --hard HEAD~2 && git push --force`

The key was already removed from files, but remains in git history.
