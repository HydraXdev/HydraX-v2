## üö® Conflict Tracking & Review Items

### Active Conflicts
| Date | Conflict | Blueprint Says | Reality/Issue | Commander Decision |
|------|----------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 2025-01-05 | EA v1.1 Compilation | Should work | StringFormat has 13 params but only 9 specifiers on line 82 | Pending |

### Flagged for Review
1. **[Date]** - Issue description - Awaiting Commander guidance
2. **[Date]** - Issue description - Awaiting Commander guidance

## üìã Implementation Notes

### Current Blockers
1. **MT5 Bridge**: Parser not implemented
2. **Database**: No persistence layer
3. **Authentication**: No user management
4. **Monitoring**: No observability

### Quick Decisions Needed
- [ ] PostgreSQL vs SQLite for initial development
- [ ] Redis requirement for Phase 2
- [ ] Bot personality implementation approach
- [ ] UI corruption effects scope

## üîÑ Session Handover Notes

### Last Session Summary
- Created comprehensive build plan
- Analyzed all blueprint documentation
- Identified missing features from UI/UX and PsyOps specs
- Set up command authority structure

### Current Session Work (2025-01-05)
- ‚úÖ Updated CLAUDE.md with Commander authority structure
- ‚úÖ Created HANDOVER.md for continuous work tracking
- ‚úÖ Analyzed existing FileBridgeEA.mq5 implementation
- ‚úÖ Fixed EA v1.1 StringFormat compilation error
- ‚úÖ Upgraded to BITTENBridge_HYBRID_v1.2_PRODUCTION as primary EA
- ‚úÖ Archived old EA versions to src/bridge/archive/
- ‚úÖ Updated all documentation references to new EA
- üìù Documented why file bridge approach is used (security, reliability)

### EA Bridge Analysis
**Current BITTENBridge_HYBRID_v1.2_PRODUCTION.mq5**:
- Enhanced JSON file-based communication with status monitoring
- Polls instruction.json with configurable intervals
- Executes market orders with advanced validation
- Returns detailed status via result.json and status.json
- Supports heartbeat monitoring and error recovery
- Previous versions archived in src/bridge/archive/ for reference

**Why File Bridge**:
1. Broker security restrictions on direct API
2. More reliable than network connections
3. Simple implementation without auth complexity
4. Universal compatibility with MT5

### Next Immediate Tasks
1. Analyze hybrid vs enhanced EA when available
2. Start Phase 1.1: MT5 bridge implementation
3. Design database schema
4. Review any flagged conflicts
