# üîí HARD LOCK Trade Size Validation - Implementation Complete

## Overview
The HARD LOCK system has been successfully implemented to prevent trades from exceeding safe percentages of account balance, ensuring that no trade can blow an account or exceed daily risk caps, regardless of tier or signal quality.

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Risk Management System Updates** (`risk_management.py`)
- Enhanced `validate_trade_size_hard_lock()` method with tier-specific limits
- Integrated configuration-based risk limits
- Added multi-level validation checks

### 2. **Fire Router Integration** (`fire_router.py`)
- Updated `_check_risk_limits()` method to use hard lock validation
- Added automatic lot size adjustment when trades exceed limits
- Integrated with account info and risk profile systems

### 3. **Configuration Updates** (`tier_settings.yml`)
- Added tier-specific risk overrides:
  - NIBBLER: 2.0% max per trade
  - FANG: 2.5% max per trade
  - COMMANDER: 3.0% max per trade
  - APEX: 3.0% max per trade
- Global hard cap: 5.0% (never exceeded)
- Added `auto_adjust_enabled: true` for automatic size reduction
- Added bitmode configuration from user specifications

## Validation Layers

### Layer 1: Tier-Specific Risk Limits
- Each tier has a maximum risk percentage per trade
- Automatically enforced based on user's subscription level

### Layer 2: Daily Risk Cap Protection
- Prevents total daily losses from exceeding limits:
  - NIBBLER/FANG: 6% daily cap
  - COMMANDER/APEX: 10% daily cap
- Tracks cumulative daily P&L
- Reduces or blocks trades that would exceed cap

### Layer 3: Account Preservation
- Never allows account to fall below $100
- Calculates maximum safe loss before hitting minimum

### Layer 4: Global Safety Cap
- Absolute maximum of 5% risk per trade
- Overrides all other settings as final safety net

## Auto-Adjustment Feature
When a trade exceeds limits, the system will:
1. Calculate the maximum safe lot size
2. Automatically reduce the position size
3. Proceed with the adjusted size
4. Notify the user of the adjustment

## Example Messages
- **Size Adjusted**: "‚ö†Ô∏è Trade size adjusted for safety: 0.50 ‚Üí 0.20 lots"
- **Daily Cap**: "üõë TRADE BLOCKED: Daily risk cap of 6% already reached"
- **Tier Limit**: "üîí SAFETY LOCK: Trade exceeds NIBBLER limit of 2%"

## Testing Results
All test scenarios passed successfully:
- ‚úÖ Normal trades within limits: APPROVED
- ‚úÖ Trades exceeding tier limits: BLOCKED with safe size suggestion
- ‚úÖ Small account protection: WORKING
- ‚úÖ Daily cap enforcement: WORKING
- ‚úÖ Account preservation: WORKING

## Integration with Bitmode
The system respects the bitmode configuration:
```yaml
bitmode:
  tcs_min: 75
  risk_default: 2.0
  risk_boost: 2.5
  boost_min_balance: 500
  trades_per_day: 6
  max_open_trades: 1
  cooldown_mode: trade_complete
  drawdown_cap: 6
  min_balance: 500
  fire_type: manual
  auto_fire: false
  stealth: false
```

## Production Notes
In production, the system will:
1. Fetch real account balance from MT5
2. Calculate actual pip values based on current prices
3. Track real P&L throughout the day
4. Store trade history for audit trail

The HARD LOCK system is now fully wired in and ready to protect traders from excessive risk!
