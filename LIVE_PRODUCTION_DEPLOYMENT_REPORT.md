## 🔥 LIVE EXECUTION CAPABILITIES

### Real-Time Signal Execution

The bridge tunnel can now process Linux signals in real-time and execute them on Windows MT5:

**Example Execution Flow:**

```json
Linux Input:
{
  "symbol": "EURUSD",
  "direction": "buy",
  "tcs": 85,
  "entry_price": 1.0875,
  "stop_loss": 1.0825,
  "take_profit": 1.0925,
  "risk_percent": 2.0
}

Windows Output:
{
  "signal_num": 12345,
  "symbol": "EURUSD",
  "direction": "BUY",
  "tcs": 85,
  "timestamp": "2025-07-17T03:10:44.228820",
  "source": "PRODUCTION_BRIDGE_TUNNEL",
  "entry_price": 1.0875,
  "stop_loss": 1.0825,
  "take_profit": 1.0925,
  "risk_percent": 2.0,
  "magic_number": 50001
}
```
