## üìä EXPECTED PERFORMANCE IMPACT

### Win Rate Improvement
- **Target**: 8-15% win rate increase
- **Mechanism**: Avoid trading during volatile news events
- **Risk Reduction**: Block trading during major market movers

### Signal Frequency Preservation
- **Target**: Maintain 85%+ signal frequency
- **Tier 1 BLOCK**: 5-10% of trading time (high-impact USD events)
- **Tier 2 REDUCE**: 15-20% of trading time (medium-impact events)
- **Tier 3 NORMAL**: 70-80% of trading time (unfiltered)

---

## üéõÔ∏è USAGE GUIDE

### Automatic Operation
The news filter is **enabled by default** and requires no configuration. It will:
- Automatically fetch the economic calendar daily
- Block trading during high-impact events (NFP, FOMC, CPI, GDP)
- Reduce confidence during medium-impact events (PMI, Retail Sales)
- Continue normal operation 85%+ of the time

### Manual Control
```python
# Access Elite Guard instance
guard = EliteGuardWithCitadel()

# Control methods
guard.enable_news_filter()    # Enable filtering
guard.disable_news_filter()   # Disable for A/B testing
guard.get_news_filter_status() # Get statistics and status
guard.force_news_calendar_update() # Manual calendar refresh

# Status monitoring
status = guard.get_news_filter_status()
print(f"Enabled: {status['enabled']}")
print(f"Block rate: {status['statistics']['block_rate']:.1f}%")
print(f"Events loaded: {status['calendar_events_total']}")
```

### A/B Testing
```python
# Disable for testing
guard.disable_news_filter()
# Run trading session without news filtering

# Re-enable to compare results
guard.enable_news_filter()
# Compare win rates between filtered and unfiltered periods
```

## üìã FILTERING LOGIC

### Tier 1: BLOCK (Hard Filter)
- **Events**: Nonfarm Payrolls, FOMC, CPI, GDP, Interest Rate Decisions
- **Scope**: USD high-impact events only
- **Time Window**: 15 minutes before/after event
- **Action**: Skip entire pattern scanning cycle
- **Expected Impact**: 5-10% of trading time blocked

### Tier 2: REDUCE (Soft Filter)
- **Events**: PMI, Manufacturing PMI, Services PMI, Retail Sales, Employment Claims
- **Scope**: USD/EUR medium-impact events
- **Time Window**: 30 minutes before/after event  
- **Action**: Reduce signal confidence by 10 points
- **Expected Impact**: 15-20% of signals affected

### Tier 3: NORMAL
- **Condition**: All other times (85%+ of trading)
- **Action**: No filtering - trade normally
- **Impact**: Maintains existing signal frequency

## üîß TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Data Source
- **API**: Forex Factory free JSON feed
- **URL**: `https://cdn-nfs.faireconomy.media/ff_calendar_thisweek.json`
- **Update Frequency**: Daily (cached locally)
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation if API unavailable

### Integration Points
1. **Initialization**: `EliteGuardWithCitadel.__init__()` line 136-140
2. **Main Loop**: Pattern scanning evaluation at line 1880-1900
3. **ML Scoring**: Confidence penalty at line 1352-1355
4. **Statistics**: Performance tracking at line 2094-2105

### Error Handling
- Network timeout handling (10-second timeout)
- Exponential backoff on failures (3 retries)
- Graceful degradation if calendar unavailable
- Local caching for offline operation
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## üî¨ A/B TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

### Testing Strategy
1. **Week 1**: Run with news filter enabled (baseline)
2. **Week 2**: Disable filter for comparison
3. **Week 3**: Re-enable filter to confirm improvement
4. **Analysis**: Compare win rates, signal quality, drawdown

### Key Metrics to Track
- Win rate: Target 8-15% improvement
- Signal frequency: Should maintain 85%+
- Max drawdown: Should reduce during news events
- Profit factor: Expected improvement
- Sharpe ratio: Risk-adjusted returns

```bash
# Enable for production
guard.enable_news_filter()

# Disable for A/B testing  
guard.disable_news_filter()

- **Response Time**: <100ms for filtering decisions
- **Memory Usage**: <10MB additional overhead

---

## üìû SUPPORT & TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues

**Calendar Not Updating**
- Check network connectivity to `cdn-nfs.faireconomy.media`
- Verify no firewall blocking HTTPS requests
- Review logs for specific error messages
- Use `guard.force_news_calendar_update()` for manual refresh

**Filter Not Working**
- Verify `guard.news_gate.enabled == True`
- Check if any high-impact events are scheduled
- Review filter statistics for evaluation counts
- Ensure integration points not bypassed

**Performance Impact**
- Monitor CPU/memory usage (should be minimal)
- Check if blocking too frequently (>15% of time)
- Verify calendar contains reasonable number of events
- Review confidence penalty application in logs

### Debug Commands
```python
# Check filter status
status = guard.get_news_filter_status()
print(status)

# Force calendar update
success = guard.force_news_calendar_update()

# View upcoming events
upcoming = guard.news_gate.get_upcoming_events(24)
for event in upcoming:
    print(f"{event.country} {event.impact}: {event.title}")

# Check statistics
stats = guard.news_gate.get_statistics()
print(f"Block rate: {stats['block_rate']:.1f}%")
```
