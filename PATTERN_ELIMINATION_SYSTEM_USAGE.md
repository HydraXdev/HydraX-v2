# BITTEN Pattern Elimination System - Usage Guide

## 🎯 System Overview

The sophisticated pattern elimination system with two-stage quarantine has been successfully implemented to prevent killing winners during variance periods. The system includes 7 integrated components with intelligent analysis and safety mechanisms.

## 📊 System Components

### 1. **Expectancy Calculator** (`expectancy_calculator.py`)
- **Purpose**: Core EV calculation engine with rolling windows
- **Key Features**:
  - Rolling 50-100 signal windows per pattern
  - Safety zone: ±5% of breakeven protection
  - Example: 35% win at 3:1 RR = +0.40 EV (KEEP!)
  - Variance analysis to detect temporary downswings

### 2. **Pattern Quarantine Manager** (`pattern_quarantine_manager.py`)
- **Purpose**: Two-stage elimination system (quarantine → kill)
- **Stage 1**: QUARANTINE - Demo-only mode for negative EV patterns (50 signals)
- **Stage 2**: KILL - Full elimination after extended negative performance (100 signals)
- **Safety**: Patterns can RECOVER from quarantine if performance improves

### 3. **Convergence Tracker** (`convergence_tracker.py`)
- **Purpose**: Multi-pattern alignment detector with confidence boosting
- **Features**:
  - Detects 2+ patterns aligning within 60 seconds
  - Boosts confidence +10% per additional pattern
  - High-conviction trades often have highest edge
  - Real-time ZMQ monitoring

### 4. **Dynamic Outcome Tracker** (`dynamic_outcome_tracker.py`)
- **Purpose**: ATR-based resolution tracking
- **Features**:
  - Replaces fixed 60min checks with dynamic horizons
  - Tracks until TP/SL hit OR 3x expected time (max 4 hours)
  - Prevents misclassifying slow-burn winners as failures
  - Adapts to market volatility

### 5. **Confidence Calibrator** (`confidence_calibrator.py`)
- **Purpose**: Fix miscalibrated confidence scores
- **Features**:
  - Audits if 80% confidence actually wins 80% of time
  - Calculates calibration offsets per bucket (70-75, 75-80, etc.)
  - If 80% signals only win 62%, adjusts future scores down by 18%
  - Statistical significance testing

### 6. **Regime Analyzer** (`regime_analyzer.py`)
- **Purpose**: Context-aware performance splitting by market regime
- **Features**:
  - Tags signals with TREND/RANGE (ADX), VOL level (ATR), Session
  - Calculates expectancy PER REGIME not globally
  - Pattern might fail in Asian range but print money in London trend
  - Session-aware analysis

### 7. **Adaptive Review Scheduler** (`adaptive_review_scheduler.py`)
- **Purpose**: Smart review cadence based on signal frequency
- **Schedules**:
  - Fast patterns (5+ signals/day): Review every 24-48 hours
  - Medium patterns (1-5/day): Review every 3-5 days
  - Slow patterns (<1/day): Review weekly
  - Risk-based adjustments for poor performers

## 📈 Current System Status

✅ **All Services Operational**
- 4 patterns currently being monitored
- Two-stage quarantine system active
- Safety zone protection enabled (±5% breakeven)
- Real-time convergence detection running
- Adaptive review schedules generated

### Pattern Status Summary:
- **ORDER_BLOCK_BOUNCE**: 100% win rate, +37.5 EV (SAFE)
- **LIQUIDITY_SWEEP_REVERSAL**: 50% win rate, +7.5 EV (SAFE ZONE)
- **VCB_BREAKOUT**: 100% win rate, +45.0 EV (SAFE)
- **FAIR_VALUE_GAP_FILL**: 0% win rate, -25.0 EV (MONITOR - needs more data)

## 🛡️ Safety Mechanisms

### 1. **Safety Zone Protection**
- Patterns within ±5% of breakeven are NEVER eliminated
- Protects against normal variance misinterpretation
- Prevents killing temporarily struggling winners

### 2. **Two-Stage Process**
- Stage 1: QUARANTINE (demo-only, can recover)
- Stage 2: KILL (only after extended poor performance)
- Recovery path available at any stage

### 3. **Variance Analysis**
- Rolling expectancy windows detect unusual periods
- Z-score analysis identifies temporary downswings
- Recommendations to wait for normalization

### 4. **Regime-Aware Evaluation**
- Patterns evaluated per market condition
- Accounts for session-specific performance
- Prevents global elimination of regime-specific winners

### Key Metrics to Monitor:
1. **Pattern Win Rates**: Should align with historical performance
2. **Expectancy Values**: Focus on positive expectancy maintenance
3. **Quarantine Status**: Monitor for false quarantines
4. **Convergence Rate**: Track multi-pattern alignment frequency
5. **Review Schedule**: Ensure timely pattern evaluations

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### DO NOT Eliminate Patterns If:
- Sample size < 50 signals (Stage 1 threshold)
- Expectancy within ±5% of breakeven (safety zone)
- Recent Z-score > 2.0 (unusual variance period)
- Strong performance in specific regime/session

### Immediate Action Required If:
- Pattern has negative expectancy < -5% with 100+ signals
- Pattern fails in ALL market regimes consistently
- Confidence calibration shows >20% overconfidence
