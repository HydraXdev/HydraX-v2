# üéØ Personalized Mission Briefs - ACTIVE

**Date**: 2025-07-08  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Running on port 8888

## What's New

The mission briefs now include **personal stats** that make users feel seen and help them make better trading decisions:

### Personal Stats Bar Shows:
- **Gamertag & Level**: "Soldier_X LVL 5"
- **Trades Today**: "3/6" (shows remaining trades)
- **Win Rate**: "75%" (with color coding)
- **P&L Today**: "+2.4%" (green for profit, red for loss)
- **Streak**: "W3" (win streak) or "L2" (loss streak)

### Decision Helper
The system provides contextual advice based on user's current performance:
- üî• "Strong signal + Good form = GO!" (high TCS + good win rate)
- üéØ "High confidence signal. Trust the process." (high TCS, lower win rate)
- üí≠ "Low score. Save shots for better setups?" (low TCS, few trades left)
- üõ°Ô∏è "Rough patch. Maybe take a break?" (losing streak)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Daily limit reached! Save this for tomorrow." (no trades left)
