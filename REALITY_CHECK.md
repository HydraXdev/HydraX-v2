# üö® REALITY CHECK - July 18, 2025

## WHAT WE ACTUALLY BUILT:
‚ùå **NOT REAL TRADING** - Just JSON file creation  
‚ùå **NO MT5 CONNECTION** - No actual terminal running  
‚ùå **NO BROKER CONNECTION** - No link to Coinexx account  
‚ùå **FAKE TICKETS** - Generated by our code, not broker  

## WHAT WE NEED FOR REAL TRADING:

### Option 1: Real MT5 Terminal
- Install MT5 via Wine
- Connect to Coinexx Demo (843859)
- Install EA to read JSON files and execute
- Requires GUI/VNC setup

### Option 2: Direct Broker API
- Use Coinexx API directly
- Skip MT5 entirely  
- Direct REST/WebSocket connection
- Real account integration

### Option 3: MetaTrader Web API
- Use MT5 Web API
- Connect via HTTP requests
- Real broker execution

## CURRENT STATUS:
**SIMULATION ONLY** - No money at risk but no real execution

The user wants to see actual account balance changes on their Coinexx Demo account (843859).

## RECOMMENDATION:
Since market is closing soon, we should either:
1. Set up real MT5 + VNC quickly  
2. Use Coinexx REST API if available
3. Admit we need more time for real setup

**USER EXPECTATION: See actual trades in Coinexx account balance**
