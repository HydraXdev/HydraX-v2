# BITTEN Risk Management Safety Features

## Overview
The enhanced risk management system now includes comprehensive safety features to protect traders from common pitfalls and enforce discipline.

## New Safety Features

### 1. Daily Loss Limits by Tier
- **NIBBLER**: -7% daily loss limit
- **FANG/COMMANDER/**: -10% daily loss limit
- Automatic position closure when limit is reached
- Trading disabled for remainder of the day

### 2. Tilt Detection & Forced Breaks
- **Warning Level**: 3 consecutive losses
- **Lockout Level**: 4+ consecutive losses
- **Forced Break**: 1 hour mandatory pause after lockout
- Tilt strikes reset on winning trade

### 3. Medic Mode
- **Activation**: -5% daily drawdown
- **Risk Reduction**: 50% of normal risk
- **Position Limit**: Maximum 1 open position
- **Purpose**: Helps traders recover carefully

### 4. Weekend Trading Limits
- **Max Positions**: 1 (reduced from normal)
- **Risk Multiplier**: 0.5 (50% of normal risk)
- **Active**: Saturday & Sunday
- **Rationale**: Lower liquidity weekends

### 5. News Event Lockouts
- **Lockout Window**: 30 minutes before/after high impact news
- **Affected Pairs**: Any pair containing the news currency
- **Impact Levels**: Only "high" impact events trigger lockout
- **Real-time Updates**: News events tracked dynamically

### 6. Trading States
```python
class TradingState(Enum):
    NORMAL = "normal"
    TILT_WARNING = "tilt_warning"
    TILT_LOCKOUT = "tilt_lockout"
    MEDIC_MODE = "medic_mode"
    WEEKEND_LIMITED = "weekend_limited"
    NEWS_LOCKOUT = "news_lockout"
    DAILY_LIMIT_HIT = "daily_limit_hit"
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

### RiskCalculator Integration
The `RiskCalculator` now checks all restrictions before allowing position sizing:
```python
# Example usage
calculator = RiskCalculator(risk_manager)
result = calculator.calculate_position_size(
    account=account,
    profile=profile,
    symbol="EURUSD",
    entry_price=1.1000,
    stop_loss_price=1.0950
)

if result['can_trade']:
    # Place trade with calculated size
    lot_size = result['lot_size']
else:
    # Show restriction reason to user
    print(result['reason'])
```

### Session Tracking
Each user has a persistent trading session that tracks:
- Daily P&L
- Consecutive wins/losses
- Tilt strikes
- Trading state
- Trade count

### Safety Utilities
```python
# Get formatted warnings
warnings = SafetySystemIntegration.format_risk_warning(restrictions)

# Get session statistics
stats = SafetySystemIntegration.get_session_stats(risk_manager, user_id)

# Check if positions should be force-closed
should_exit, reason = SafetySystemIntegration.should_force_exit(
    risk_manager, profile, account
)
```

## Implementation Notes

1. **RiskManager**: Central coordinator for all safety checks
2. **TradingSession**: Per-user session tracking (resets daily)
3. **NewsEvent**: Tracks upcoming high-impact events
4. **AccountInfo**: Enhanced with starting_balance for daily calculations

## Example Workflow

1. User requests to open position
2. RiskManager checks all restrictions:
   - Daily loss limit
   - Tilt status
   - Medic mode
   - Weekend limits
   - News lockouts
3. If allowed, RiskCalculator adjusts position size based on:
   - Active restrictions
   - Tier multipliers
   - Safety adjustments
4. Position is opened with safety-adjusted parameters
5. After trade closes, session is updated
6. New restrictions may activate based on results

## Benefits

- **Protects Capital**: Hard stops on daily losses
- **Prevents Revenge Trading**: Tilt detection and forced breaks
- **Gradual Recovery**: Medic mode for careful comebacks
- **Market Awareness**: News lockouts prevent volatility losses
- **Tier Progression**: Higher tiers get more flexibility

## Future Enhancements

1. **AI Tilt Prediction**: Detect tilt patterns before losses
2. **Personalized Limits**: ML-based custom safety thresholds
3. **Recovery Coaching**: Guided meditation during forced breaks
4. **Social Accountability**: Share safety stats with accountability partners
5. **Streak Bonuses**: Reward consistent safe trading
