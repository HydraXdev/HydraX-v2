## Implementation Notes

### For Developers

1. **Always use secure versions in production**
   - Import from `*_secure.py` files
   - Use `BITTENBridge_*_SECURE.mq5` in MT5

2. **Configuration**
   - Set environment variables for sensitive data
   - Never hardcode credentials
   - Use secure random tokens

3. **Testing**
   - Test all validation boundaries
   - Verify rate limits work
   - Check error handling paths
   - Test concurrent operations

### For Operations

1. **Monitoring**
   - Watch for rate limit violations
   - Monitor failed trade attempts
   - Check daily trade counts
   - Review error logs regularly

2. **Maintenance**
   - Rotate API keys periodically
   - Update file permissions
   - Clean old log files
   - Review security audit findings

## BITTEN Narrative Preservation

Each secure file maintains the BITTEN character voices:

- **DRILL**: Military discipline, by-the-book validation
- **DOC**: Protective care through data sanitization
- **NEXUS**: Network security and authentication focus
- **OVERWATCH**: Cynical truth about market risks

The security enhancements are woven into the narrative, making security feel like part of the BITTEN experience rather than a technical burden.

## Next Steps

1. Deploy secure versions to production
2. Run penetration testing
3. Set up security monitoring
4. Train team on secure practices
5. Regular security audits
