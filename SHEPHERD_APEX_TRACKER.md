## üõ°Ô∏è BITTEN SAFETY INTEGRATION

### User Protection Layers
```
1. MAX 6 TRADES/DAY (regardless of 150+ signals)
2. 2% RISK PER TRADE (position sizing)
3. 7% DAILY DRAWDOWN LIMIT (emergency stop)
4. TCS FILTERING (users see quality scores)
5. XP PUNISHMENT (low TCS = warnings)
```

### Signal Flow to Users
```
Engine Generates: ALL signals TCS 35+
BITTEN Filters: By user tier + state
User Sees: Appropriate quality only
User Executes: Maximum 6 per day
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNINGS FOR SHEPHERD

### EXTREME AGGRESSION ALERT
```
üö® This engine is configured for MAXIMUM extraction
üö® TCS 35-40 is ULTRA aggressive (normal is 70+)
üö® Designed to find absolute system limits
üö® REQUIRES BITTEN safety constraints
üö® NOT suitable for standalone use
```

### Implementation Requirements
```
‚úÖ Must have daily trade limits (6 max)
‚úÖ Must have position sizing (2% risk)  
‚úÖ Must have drawdown stops (7% daily)
‚úÖ Must have TCS quality filtering
‚úÖ Must have user education about TCS
```

---

## üéØ MATHEMATICAL EDGE

### Expected Value Calculation
```
Win Rate: 89%
Risk:Reward: 1:2 average
Expected Value per trade: +1.67 units

6 trades @ +1.67 = +10 units daily
Monthly compound potential: 300%+
Annual trajectory: $1K ‚Üí $1M+
```

### Hourly Signal Distribution Target
```
QUIET HOURS:  2-3 signals/hour (Asian overnight)
ACTIVE HOURS: 8-12 signals/hour (London)
PEAK HOURS:   15-20 signals/hour (OVERLAP)
TOTAL TARGET: 175 signals/day
```

## üí¨ SHEPHERD NOTES

**Purpose**: This tracker ensures the v5.0 engine specifications are never lost and remain accessible to any AI assistant working on the BITTEN system.

**Key Insight**: The engine is intentionally hyper-aggressive (TCS 35-40) because BITTEN's safety systems (6 trade limit, 2% risk, TCS filtering) turn this aggression into controlled precision.

**Philosophy**: "Give users 150+ opportunities daily, but protect them from taking more than 6 high-quality ones."

**Update Instructions**: When engine parameters change, update both the main blueprint file AND this tracker to maintain system consistency.
