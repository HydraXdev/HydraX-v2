## üîë Required Stripe Keys

### 1. **Environment Variables (.env)**

Add these keys to your `/root/HydraX-v2/.env` file:

```bash
# Stripe Configuration (REPLACE with your actual keys)
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE  
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_HERE

# Stripe Price IDs (will be generated by setup script)
STRIPE_PRICE_NIBBLER=price_nibbler_monthly
STRIPE_PRICE_FANG=price_fang_monthly
STRIPE_PRICE_COMMANDER=price_commander_monthly
STRIPE_PRICE_APEX=price_apex_monthly
```

### 2. **Where to Get These Keys**

1. **Publishable & Secret Keys**: 
   - Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
   - Copy your **Live** keys (pk_live_... and sk_live_...)

2. **Webhook Secret**:
   - Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
   - Create endpoint: `https://your-domain.com/stripe/webhook`

   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`

## üéØ How It Works

### Payment Flow:
1. User visits `/upgrade?tier=FANG`
2. User clicks "üí≥ Pay with Card (Stripe)"
3. JavaScript calls `/api/create-checkout-session`
4. Stripe creates secure checkout session
5. User redirected to Stripe-hosted payment form
6. After payment: redirect to `/payment-success`
7. Webhook confirms subscription activation

### Available Endpoints:
- `POST /api/create-checkout-session` - Create payment session
- `GET /payment-success` - Handle successful payments
- `POST /stripe/webhook` - Process Stripe events
- `GET /upgrade` - Upgrade page with payment options
