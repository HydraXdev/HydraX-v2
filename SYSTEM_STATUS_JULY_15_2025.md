# BITTEN System Status - July 15, 2025

## üéØ Today's Accomplishments

### 1. ‚úÖ Fire Mode System Implementation
- **SELECT FIRE Mode**: One-click confirmation system for all users
- **AUTO Mode**: 90%+ TCS autonomous execution for COMMANDER tier
- **/mode Command**: Inline keyboard for mode switching
- **Slot Management**: 1-3 configurable slots for AUTO mode
- **Database Backend**: Complete tracking and history

### 2. ‚úÖ Fire Mode Naming Standardization
- Renamed MANUAL ‚Üí SELECT FIRE across entire codebase
- Renamed SEMI-AUTO ‚Üí SELECT FIRE (consolidated)
- Renamed FULL_AUTO ‚Üí AUTO
- Updated all documentation and configuration files
- Added backward compatibility mapping

### 3. ‚úÖ Tier System Simplification
- Reduced from 5 tiers to 3 paid tiers + trial
- APEX features merged into COMMANDER tier
- COMMANDER now has AUTO mode exclusively
- Updated pricing and access controls

### 4. ‚úÖ BIT Integration
- AI companion cat fully integrated into production bot
- Trade reactions, error comfort, daily wisdom
- /bit command for direct interaction
- Enhanced all major commands with BIT's personality

## üî¥ Critical Tasks Remaining

### Fire Mode Integration
1. **Connect to Real Trading**
   - SELECT FIRE confirmation needs to call fire_mission_for_user()
   - AUTO fire needs to execute actual trades
   - Currently just shows success messages

2. **Start AUTO Fire Monitor**
   - auto_fire_monitor.py exists but not running
   - Needs user tier lookup integration
   - Should start with bot initialization

### Existing Systems to Connect
3. **XP System** - Complete but not called on trades
4. **Risk Management** - Built but needs verification it's active
5. **Performance Analytics** - Ready but not recording trade results

## üìä Current Production Status

### What's Running
- `apex_v5_lean.py` - Signal generation (‚úÖ)
- `bitten_production_bot.py` - Main bot with fire modes (‚úÖ)
- `webapp_server.py` - Web interface (‚úÖ)
- `commander_throne.py` - Admin panel (‚úÖ)

### What's Built But Not Active
- XP/Gamification system
- Risk management limits
- Performance tracking
- AUTO fire monitor
- Payment webhooks

### What's Actually Missing
- Chaingun mode implementation
- Battle pass frontend
- WebApp fire mode UI

## üéÆ Fire Mode Access Summary

| Tier | Modes | Slots | Signals | Price |
|------|-------|-------|---------|-------|
| PRESS PASS | SELECT | N/A | RAPID ASSAULT view | Free |
| NIBBLER | SELECT | 1 | RAPID ASSAULT | $39 |
| FANG | SELECT | 2 | All signals | $89 |
| COMMANDER | SELECT + AUTO | 3 (AUTO) / ‚àû | All signals | $189 |

## üìù Next Steps Priority

1. **Wire up fire modes to execute real trades** (30 min)
2. **Start AUTO fire monitor** (15 min)
3. **Connect XP system to trade events** (20 min)
4. **Verify risk management is active** (10 min)
5. **Create WebApp fire mode UI** (2 hours)

## üöÄ Commands Ready for Use

- `/mode` - Change fire mode (shows keyboard)
- `/slots [1-3]` - Configure AUTO slots (COMMANDER only)
- `/fire` - Execute trade (respects fire mode)
- `/bit` - Chat with BIT AI companion

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Fire modes are UI-complete but not executing real trades yet
- All personality systems are active and working
- BIT integration is fully deployed
- Multi-broker symbols auto-detected (no action needed)
- 60+ duplicate files moved to archive

## üéØ Definition of "Complete"

Once the fire mode executor is connected to real trading and the AUTO monitor is running, the core fire mode system will be fully operational. The remaining tasks (XP, risk, analytics) are simple connections of existing systems.
