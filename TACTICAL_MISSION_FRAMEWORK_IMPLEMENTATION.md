# BITTEN Tactical Mission Framework - Complete Implementation

## Overview

The Tactical Mission Framework transforms forex education into authentic military operations, making learning engaging and immersive. Every trading signal becomes a tactical mission, every educational concept becomes military doctrine, and every trade becomes an operation with real stakes and genuine excitement.
