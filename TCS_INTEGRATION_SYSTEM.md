# TCS Integration System Documentation

## Overview

The TCS (Tactical Confidence Score) Integration System connects the self-optimizing TCS engine to the main signal flow, enabling dynamic threshold adjustment based on real-time performance data and market conditions.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Self-Optimizing TCS Engine (`self_optimizing_tcs.py`)
- **Purpose**: Dynamically adjusts TCS thresholds to maintain optimal signal volume and win rates
- **Key Features**:
  - Target signal volume: 65 signals/day
  - Minimum TCS threshold: 70%
  - Maximum TCS threshold: 78%
  - Target win rate: 85%
  - Adjustments every 4 hours based on 24-hour lookbacks

### 2. TCS Integration Layer (`tcs_integration.py`)
- **Purpose**: Main integration component that connects TCS optimizer to signal flow
- **Key Classes**:
  - `TCSIntegrationLayer`: Main coordinator
  - `TCSPerformanceTracker`: Basic performance tracking
  - `MarketConditionAnalyzer`: Market condition assessment

### 3. Advanced Performance Tracker (`tcs_performance_tracker.py`)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive performance tracking with database storage
- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time position monitoring
  - Trade performance metrics
  - Threshold effectiveness analysis
  - SQLite database for persistence

### 4. Signal Fusion Integration (`signal_fusion.py`)
- **Purpose**: Enhanced signal fusion engine with TCS filtering
- **Key Features**:
  - Dynamic TCS thresholds per pair
  - TCS filtering before tier determination
  - Enhanced statistics with TCS data

### 5. Complete Signal Flow Integration (`complete_signal_flow_v3.py`)
- **Purpose**: Main signal flow updated to use TCS optimization
- **Key Features**:
  - TCS integration initialization
  - Performance tracking integration
  - Enhanced trade execution with TCS tracking

## Data Flow

```
1. Market Data → MarketConditionAnalyzer → Market Conditions
2. Historical Performance → TCS Optimizer → Optimal Thresholds
3. Signal Sources → Signal Fusion → TCS Filtering → Tier Assignment
4. Trade Execution → Performance Tracker → Database Storage
5. Performance Data → TCS Optimizer → Threshold Adjustment
```

## Key Integration Points

### 1. Signal Generation
- Market intelligence is collected and fused
- TCS thresholds are applied during signal fusion
- Only signals above dynamic threshold proceed to tier assignment

### 2. Trade Execution
- TCS threshold and market conditions are recorded
- Performance tracking begins immediately
- Trade metadata includes TCS information

### 3. Performance Feedback
- Closed positions are analyzed for TCS performance
- Results feed back to TCS optimizer for threshold adjustment
- Real-time monitoring provides immediate feedback

### 4. Threshold Optimization
- TCS optimizer runs every 4 hours
- Considers signal volume, win rate, and market conditions
- Updates thresholds across all monitored pairs

## Configuration

### Default TCS Thresholds
- EURUSD: 75.0%
- GBPUSD: 75.0%
- USDJPY: 75.0%
- XAUUSD: 75.0%
- AUDUSD: 75.0%

### Optimization Parameters
- Target signals per day: 65
- Signal volume tolerance: ±15%
- Adjustment interval: 4 hours
- Lookback period: 24 hours

## Database Schema

### TCS Adjustments
- Timestamp, pair, old/new thresholds
- Reason for adjustment
- Performance metrics at time of adjustment

### Trade Performance
- Complete trade lifecycle tracking
- TCS threshold used, market conditions
- Performance metrics (pips, profit, hold time)

### Signal Volume Tracking
- Hourly signal generation statistics
- Execution rates by pair and hour
- Confidence and threshold tracking

## Usage Examples

### Initialize TCS Integration
```python
from src.bitten_core.tcs_integration import initialize_tcs_integration
from src.bitten_core.signal_fusion import signal_fusion_engine

# Initialize integration
integration = initialize_tcs_integration(mt5_adapter, signal_fusion_engine)
await integration.start_monitoring()
```

### Get TCS Statistics
```python
# Get comprehensive stats
stats = integration.get_integration_stats()

# Get enhanced fusion stats
fusion_stats = signal_fusion_engine.get_tcs_enhanced_stats()
```

### Update TCS Thresholds
```python
# Update threshold for specific pair
new_threshold = await integration.update_tcs_thresholds("EURUSD")

# Manually set threshold
signal_fusion_engine.update_tcs_threshold("EURUSD", 77.5)
```

## Testing

### Test Suite
Run the complete integration test suite:
```bash
python test_tcs_integration.py
```

### Test Components
1. **TCS Optimizer**: Basic functionality and threshold calculation
2. **Performance Tracking**: Database operations and real-time monitoring
3. **Signal Fusion**: TCS filtering and threshold updates
4. **Complete Integration**: Full system integration test
5. **Threshold Adjustment**: Dynamic threshold optimization

## Performance Metrics

### Key Metrics Tracked
- **Signal Volume**: Signals generated per day/hour
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trades
- **Execution Rate**: Percentage of signals executed
- **Threshold Effectiveness**: Performance by TCS threshold level
- **Market Condition Performance**: Results by volatility/session

### Optimization Targets
- Maintain 65 signals/day (±15% tolerance)
- Achieve 85% win rate target
- Minimize threshold adjustments while maintaining performance

## Market Condition Assessment

### Volatility Levels
- **LOW**: ATR < 20, Spread < 2
