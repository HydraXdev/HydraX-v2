## 🎮 Fire Mode Mechanics

### FULL AUTO Mode (COMMANDER/APEX only)
1. User sets number of trading slots
2. When a slot opens (trade closes), system automatically:
   - Checks next available signal
   - Validates against user's risk settings
   - Executes trade into open slot
3. No manual intervention needed
4. Can switch to SEMI if manual control desired

### Key Point
The main difference between FANG and COMMANDER is the **fire selector** - COMMANDER can go hands-free with autonomous slot-based execution, while FANG must manually click each trade.
