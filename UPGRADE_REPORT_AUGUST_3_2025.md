## 📊 Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Market Data (Port 8001)
    ↓
Signal Vitality Engine (calculate decay)
    ↓
Educational Content Generation
    ↓
Fresh Fire Builder (if executing)
    ↓
Adjusted Parameters to EA
```

### Caching Strategy
```
Redis Cache (if available):
- Vitality: 30-second TTL
- Market data: Referenced from receiver
- Per-mission caching

Fallback (if Redis unavailable):
- In-memory dictionary cache
- Same TTL behavior
- Automatic cleanup
```

### Calculation Weights
```python
vitality_score = (
    price_impact * 0.5 +   # 50% weight
    spread_impact * 0.3 +  # 30% weight
    volume_impact * 0.2    # 20% weight
) * 100
```

## 🎓 Educational Content System

### Price Drift Classifications
- **Minor** (<5 pips): 95% vitality retained, minimal impact
- **Moderate** (5-15 pips): 70% vitality retained, entry adjustment needed
- **Major** (>15 pips): 30% vitality retained, significant risk

### Spread Change Classifications
- **Normal** (<1.5x): No penalty, good execution conditions
- **Elevated** (1.5-2.5x): 20% penalty, increased costs
- **Extreme** (>2.5x): 50% penalty, very expensive execution

### Volume Change Classifications
- **Liquid** (>70%): No penalty, good fills expected
- **Moderate** (40-70%): 15% penalty, some slippage risk
- **Thin** (<40%): 40% penalty, high slippage risk

### Dynamic Educational Tips
Every signal includes context-appropriate education:
- Why the signal degraded
- What market changes occurred
- How it affects execution
- Best practices for timing

## 📝 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Optional Redis configuration
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379

# Market data source
MARKET_DATA_URL=http://localhost:8001

# Cache settings
VITALITY_CACHE_TTL=30
```

### Adjustable Parameters
```python
# In signal_vitality_engine.py
cache_ttl = 30  # Seconds
price_weight = 0.5
spread_weight = 0.3
volume_weight = 0.2

# In fresh_fire_builder.py
min_drift_for_adjustment = 5  # Pips
max_risk_percent = 5.0
min_executable_vitality = 20
```

---

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the system can be disabled:

1. **Disable Vitality Calculation**: 
   - Set fallback in HUD route to always use time-based
   
2. **Disable Fresh Packets**:
   - Set `use_fresh_packet=False` in fire_router calls
   
3. **Remove API Endpoint**:
   - Comment out `/api/vitality/` route

4. **Revert Template Variables**:
   - Remove vitality data from template_vars

The system is designed with graceful fallbacks, so partial failures won't break execution.
