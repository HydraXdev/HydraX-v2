# üöÄ ZMQ Implementation Complete - August 1, 2025

## ‚úÖ All Tasks Completed

### 1. **Firewall Fixed**
- Opened ports 5555 and 5556 for ZMQ communication
- EA v7 successfully connected from ForexVPS (185.244.67.11)

### 2. **EA Connection Verified**
- EA v7 streaming telemetry every 5 seconds
- Connection logs show: `New connection from 185.244.67.11`
- Telemetry includes: Balance: $3000.00

### 3. **ZMQ Architecture Documented**
- Created `/root/HydraX-v2/BITTEN_ZMQ_ARCHITECTURE_CORE.md`
- Created `/root/HydraX-v2/docs/bitten_architecture_contract.md`
- Added mandatory headers to all critical files
- Set environment variables: `ZMQ_STRICT=1`, `ZMQ_ENFORCE=true`

### 4. **Fire Signal Testing**
- Sent test signals: `ZMQ_TEST_001` and `ZMQ_TEST_002`
- Signals successfully transmitted via port 5555
- Created test script: `test_zmq_fire_signal.py`

### 5. **Telemetry Parsing for XP/Risk**
- Created `parse_telemetry_feed.py` with:
  - XP calculation based on profit (10% of profit as XP)
  - Risk warnings for equity drops and high margin usage
  - Trade milestone tracking (1, 10, 50, 100 trades)
  - User balance and position monitoring

### 6. **Fire.txt Fallback Disabled**
- Created `mt5_zmq_adapter.py` to replace file-based adapter
- Updated `fire_router.py` to use ZMQ-only execution
- Added `ZMQ_STRICT` mode enforcement
- Removed all references to "file-based bridge"

### 7. **Trade Tracking Started**
- Created `zmq_trade_tracker.py` for confirmed trade logging
- Logs all trades to `/root/HydraX-v2/logs/zmq_trade_log.json`
- Monitors port 5556 for trade_result messages
- Displays real-time statistics and success rates

## üì° Current Status

- **ZMQ Fire Publisher**: Running (PID 2138717)
- **ZMQ Telemetry Daemon**: Running (PID 2138796)
- **ZMQ Trade Tracker**: Running (monitoring all trades)
- **EA v7**: Connected and streaming telemetry
- **Fire.txt**: DISABLED - ZMQ only mode enforced

## üîí Security Measures

1. **No File Fallback**: All file-based execution paths removed
2. **ZMQ Strict Mode**: Environment variable prevents any file operations
3. **Architecture Contract**: Immutable document defines system rules
4. **Mandatory Headers**: All files include ZMQ enforcement banner

## üìä Next Steps

The ZMQ implementation is complete. The system is now:
- Receiving real-time market data from EA
- Processing trade signals through ZMQ sockets
- Tracking all confirmed trades
- Calculating XP and monitoring risk
- Operating without any file-based fallbacks

All signal flow now goes through persistent ZMQ socket connections as required.
