# 🚀 ZMQ Pipeline Status - July 31, 2025

## ✅ What's Working

### Python Infrastructure (100% Ready)
- **ZMQ Market Streamer**: Running as systemd service
  - Connected to tcp://134.199.204.67:5555 (EA publisher)
  - Publishing on tcp://127.0.0.1:5556 (VENOM subscriber)
  - Status: Active but receiving 0 ticks
  
- **VENOM ZMQ Adapter**: Running and integrated
  - Connected to tcp://127.0.0.1:5556
  - VENOM v8 engine loaded
  - Status: Active but receiving 0 ticks

### EA Code (Ready but not deployed)
- **BITTENBridge_TradeExecutor_ZMQ_v6.mq5**: Complete implementation
  - ZMQ publisher on port 5555
  - Streams all 16 pairs including XAUUSD
  - Topic-prefixed messages: "SYMBOL {json}"
  - Includes "source":"MT5_LIVE" validation

## ❌ What's Missing

### MT5 Server Side
1. **Port 5555 not open**: Connection refused to 134.199.204.67:5555
2. **EA not publishing**: Either not running or not configured
3. **Possible issues**:
   - EA not attached to charts
   - DLL imports not enabled in MT5
   - libzmq.dll not in MT5 Libraries folder
   - Firewall blocking port 5555

## 🔧 Required Actions on MT5 Server

### 1. Deploy libzmq.dll
```
Copy libzmq.dll to:
C:\Program Files\MetaTrader 5\MQL5\Libraries\
```

### 2. Enable DLL Imports
```
Tools → Options → Expert Advisors → Allow DLL imports ✓
```

### 3. Attach EA to Charts
```
1. Compile BITTENBridge_TradeExecutor_ZMQ_v6.mq5
2. Attach to all 16 currency pair charts
3. Verify ZMQ initialization in Expert log
```

### 4. Open Port 5555
```
Windows Firewall:
- Add inbound rule for port 5555
- Or disable firewall temporarily for testing
```

## 📊 Current Data Flow

```
MT5 EA (ZMQ v6) 
    ↓ [BLOCKED - Port 5555 closed]
ZMQ Market Streamer ✅ (Waiting for data)
    ↓
VENOM ZMQ Adapter ✅ (Waiting for data)
    ↓
VENOM v8 Engine ✅ (No market data)
```

## 🎯 Once EA is Publishing

When the EA starts publishing on port 5555:

1. **Automatic Flow**: 
   - Streamer will receive ticks immediately
   - VENOM adapter will feed data to engine
   - Signals will start generating

2. **Monitoring**:
   ```bash
   # Watch streamer logs
   sudo journalctl -u zmq_market_streamer -f
   
   # Watch VENOM adapter
   tail -f /tmp/venom_zmq_adapter.log
   
   # Check VENOM signals
   tail -f /tmp/venom_stream.log
   ```

3. **Expected Output**:
   - 100+ ticks/second across 16 symbols
   - GOLD (XAUUSD) ticks marked with 🏆
   - VENOM generating signals with CITADEL shield

## 📋 Summary

**Python Side**: ✅ 100% Ready and waiting
**MT5 Side**: ❌ EA needs deployment with ZMQ DLL
**Network**: ❌ Port 5555 needs to be opened

Once the EA is properly deployed on the MT5 server with libzmq.dll and port 5555 open, the entire pipeline will automatically start flowing LIVE market data to VENOM for signal generation.
