# BB_SCALP Pattern Fix - Complete

## Issue Identified
BB_SCALP was winning only 30-40% of trades due to taking mean reversion trades during strong trends. The pattern was fighting the trend instead of respecting it.

## Fix Applied (September 9, 2025)

### 1. Added Trend Detection Logic
```python
# Lines 2323-2330: Calculate recent trend strength
recent_closes = [c['close'] for c in candles_m5[-10:]]
price_10_bars_ago = recent_closes[0]
price_now = recent_closes[-1]
trend_move = (price_now - price_10_bars_ago) / pip_size

# Strong trends = 20+ pip directional move in last 10 bars
is_strong_uptrend = trend_move > 20
is_strong_downtrend = trend_move < -20
```

### 2. Applied Trend Filter to Both Setups
- **Bearish Setup (Line 2360)**: `if current['high'] >= bb_upper and not is_strong_uptrend`
  - Don't sell at upper band if strong uptrend detected
  
- **Bullish Setup (Line 2375)**: `elif current['low'] <= bb_lower and not is_strong_downtrend`
  - Don't buy at lower band if strong downtrend detected

### 3. Kept All Other Validations
- RSI thresholds: 65/35 (balanced)
- Wick requirement: 60% for rejection confirmation
- Bollinger Bands: 2.0 standard deviations (industry standard)
- Volume confirmation: Still required for signal generation

## Expected Improvements
- **Before**: 30-40% win rate (losing in trending markets)
- **After**: Should improve to 55-65% by avoiding trend-fighting trades
- **Signal Count**: May reduce slightly but quality will improve significantly

## How It Works Now
1. Pattern detects price at Bollinger Band extreme
2. **NEW**: Checks if market is strongly trending (20+ pip move)
3. If trending, skips the signal (don't fight the trend)
4. If ranging/weak trend, proceeds with mean reversion logic
5. Validates RSI, wick pattern, and volume before signaling

## Status
âœ… FIXED and DEPLOYED - Elite Guard restarted with trend filter active
