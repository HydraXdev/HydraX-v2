## üé´ PRESS PASS: Access Mode (Tier 0)

**What it is:**
- A 7-day limited-access trading preview
- Uses a real MT5 demo account (MetaQuotes-Demo)
- Trades are live and real, but XP resets nightly at 00:00 UTC
- XP and gamertag are locked behind ENLISTMENT

**User Flow:**
1. User lands on **joinBITTEN.com**
2. Sees offer: _"Grab Your 7-Day Press Pass ‚Äì Watch the War Unfold"_
3. Enters **name + email** (stored in DB)
4. Presented with 3 options:
   - üé´ **Try Now (Press Pass)** ‚Äì auto-demo, no setup
   - üß™ **Enlist with Demo Broker** ‚Äì FOREX.com demo (requires card)
   - ‚öîÔ∏è **Go Live** ‚Äì funded live account (FOREX.com or other)
5. If they choose Press Pass:
   - MetaQuotes demo spun up
   - Assigned default user ID (name only)
   - No gamertag, no leaderboard
   - XP tracking **enabled**, but **XP resets every midnight**

**Email Cadence:**
- Day 1: "Welcome to the Warzone"
- Day 2‚Äì6: Daily updates on performance, XP lost, leaderboard teasers
- Day 7: Urgency push ‚Äî final hours alert
- Post Day 7: Weekly emails ‚Äî "REDEPLOY" campaign (_"You lost 1,034 XP. Ready to reclaim it?"_)

**Telegram / WebApp Alerts:**
- Live modal alerts: _"XP will reset in 2 hours"_
- RecruiterBot DMs: _"Observers don't earn medals. Enlist before midnight."_
- After reset: _"XP wiped. Data stored. Still watching, or ready to rank up?"_

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Considerations
- MT5 terminals spun up on isolated bridge instances
- PRESS PASS users are sandboxed from Tier 1+ live users
- Trade execution behaves the same as any other account
- Database flags:
   - `tier = press_pass`
   - `xp_mode = ghost`

---

## üìä Use Trade Count as Social Proof
- Landing page counter:
   > _"üé´ 11,237 Press Passes granted since launch. Join the next wave."_

- Optional soft daily cap: _"Only 500 PRESS PASSES issued daily. 438 claimed so far today."_ (FOMO without hard block)

- Optional viral stat use:
   > _‚ÄúIn the past 48 hours:  
   - 2,142 trades executed  
   - 1,209 XP wiped  
   - 462 new enlistees  
   - 38 funded soldiers entered LIVE OPS‚Äù_

## ‚úÖ Summary
The PRESS PASS system turns passive visitors into emotionally engaged prospects. It provides:
- Fast dopamine hits (real trades)
- A daily loss loop (XP decay)
- A strong identity hook (ENLISTING)
- Rich behavioral data (for both conversion + strategy refinement)

This funnel will outperform a generic 14-day trial by creating psychological friction, identity shaping, and long-term revenue alignment.

**XP is a mirror.  
Money is the path.  
BITTEN is the war.**
