"The military theme isn't glorifying war. It's acknowledging that trading IS a battle - against your own emotions. We're just honest about it."

## The Elevator Pitch Collection

### 10 Seconds:
"Trading platform that uses game psychology to stop you from revenge trading."

### 30 Seconds:
"I lost three trading accounts by 17. Built BITTEN to save others from my mistakes. It uses gaming mechanics to enforce discipline and turns solo trading into squad progression. Named after my cat who started it all."

### 60 Seconds:
"90% of traders fail because of psychology, not strategy. BITTEN attacks this with game design - cooldowns prevent revenge trading, 'medic mode' helps recovery, XP systems show progress during drawdowns. Built by a gamer who got destroyed by markets and refused to accept that trading has to be lonely and brutal. The military theme? Because trading IS combat against your emotions. The result? Discipline that doesn't feel like punishment."

## Remember

**You're not selling a trading platform. You're selling survival.**

Every trader has felt the bite. You're offering them a way to bite back that actually works because it's built by someone who's been bitten too.

The world doesn't need another trading platform. It needs BITTEN.

*Now go tell them why.*
