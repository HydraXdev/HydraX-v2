## The Manifesto (User-Facing)

**ATTENTION, RECRUIT.**

You stand at the edge of a new reality. You've felt the bite of the market. You've seen the easy promises, the gilded cages. You've felt the sting of loss.

**THIS IS NOT A GAME.** This is a **BATTLEFIELD.**

**WE ARE BITTEN.**

Born from necessity. Forged in personal struggle. We are the ones who refused to be victims. The ones who learned to bite back.

Our system will strip away emotion, enforce your rules, and highlight the cold logic of the market. It was built by one of us, for all of us.

**EMBRACE THE SCARS.** Each loss is a lesson. Each one makes you stronger.

You are now a **NODE**. A vital point in our expanding digital frontier.

**The market bites. But you will learn to bite back harder.**

**Welcome to the network. The battle begins.**

## Living Document Notice

This lore bible should evolve as BITTEN grows. New features should tie back to the core narrative. New voices might emerge, but they must resonate with Norman's journey and Bit's enduring presence.

Remember: At its heart, this is a story about a boy, his cat, and their fight against a rigged system. Everything else builds from there.

**Last Updated**: January 2025
**Guardian**: The ghost of an all-black cat named Bit
