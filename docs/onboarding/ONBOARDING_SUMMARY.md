## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)
```python
# 1. Create module structure
src/bitten_core/onboarding/
├── __init__.py
├── orchestrator.py      # Main state machine
├── handlers.py          # Response processors
├── validators.py        # Input validation
├── session_manager.py   # Persistence layer
└── dialogue_loader.py   # Load JSON dialogue
```

### Phase 2: Telegram Integration (Week 1-2)
```python
# 2. Integrate with existing bot
- Add /start command handler
- Implement callback query routing
- Add message handlers for text input
- Create inline keyboards
- Format messages with Markdown
```

### Phase 3: State Implementation (Week 2-3)
```python
# 3. Build each state handler
- First Contact (experience check)
- Market Demo (interactive chart)
- Training Account (form collection)
- Practice Trade (simulated execution)
- Account Selection (comparison display)
- Terms Acceptance (legal checkbox)
- Broker Linking (secure credentials)
- Callsign Creation (validation + suggestions)
```

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing (Week 3-4)
```python
# 4. Refine user experience
- Add progress indicators
- Implement timeout handling
- Create help responses
- Add skip options
- Build admin monitoring
```

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **Completion Rate**: Target 60%+
- **Time to Complete**: Target <15 minutes
- **Drop-off Points**: Identify and optimize
- **Account Creation**: 40%+ demo, 20%+ live

### Secondary Metrics
- State completion times
- Error frequency by state
- Help command usage
- Resume session rate
- Callsign creativity score

## 🔧 Technical Considerations

### State Persistence
```python
# Redis schema
{
    "onboarding:user:123456": {
        "state": "callsign_creation",
        "started_at": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
        "last_activity": "2024-01-15T10:05:00Z",
        "data": {
            "has_experience": false,
            "first_name": "John",
            "email": "john@example.com",
            "selected_theater": "regulated_demo",
            "callsign": null
        },
        "completed_states": ["first_contact", "market_warfare", ...]
    }
}
```

### Message Queue Integration
```python
# For async operations
async def process_account_creation(user_data):
    # Queue account creation with broker
    await queue.publish('broker.create_account', {
        'user_id': user_data['user_id'],
        'account_type': user_data['selected_theater'],
        'email': user_data['email']
    })
```

### Security Best Practices
- Never store broker passwords in plain text
- Use encryption for sensitive data
- Implement rate limiting on submissions
- Validate all inputs against injection
- Log security events for audit
