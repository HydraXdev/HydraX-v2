# BITTEN Signal Fusion System Documentation

## Overview

The BITTEN Signal Fusion System is an advanced trading signal generation platform that combines multiple intelligence sources to create high-confidence trading signals. The system implements a 4-tier confidence system and smart routing to ensure users receive quality signals appropriate to their subscription level.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Signal Fusion Engine** (`signal_fusion.py`)
   - Combines multiple intelligence sources
   - Calculates overall confidence scores
   - Assigns signals to confidence tiers
   - Tracks performance metrics

2. **Intelligence Aggregator** (`intelligence_aggregator.py`)
   - Collects data from all intelligence sources
   - Normalizes signal formats
   - Manages parallel processing

3. **Intelligence Sources**
   - **Technical Analyzer**: Multiple strategy analysis
   - **Sentiment Analyzer**: Market mood and conditions
   - **Fundamental Analyzer**: Session and economic factors
   - **AI Bot Analyzer**: Multiple AI personality insights

4. **Tier-Based Router**
   - Enforces daily signal limits per tier
   - Ensures quality distribution
   - Nibbler: 6 best signals/day
   - Fang: 10 signals/day
   - Commander: 15 signals/day
   - Apex: 20 signals/day

5. **Engagement Balancer**
   - Prevents signal fatigue
   - Maintains quality distribution
   - Manages time between signals

## Confidence Tiers

### üéØ SNIPER (90%+ confidence)
- Elite precision signals
- Maximum agreement between sources
- Highest historical win rate
- Priority distribution to all tiers

### ‚≠ê PRECISION (80-89% confidence)
- High-quality signals
- Strong source agreement
- Reliable performance
- Available to all tiers

### ‚ö° RAPID (70-79% confidence)
- Standard trading signals
- Good source consensus
- Solid opportunities
- Fang tier and above

### üìö TRAINING (60-69% confidence)
- Learning opportunities
- Moderate consensus
- Lower position sizing recommended
- Commander/Apex only

## Signal Fusion Process

1. **Intelligence Collection**
   ```
   Technical Analysis ‚Üí 40% weight
   Sentiment Analysis ‚Üí 20% weight
   Fundamental Analysis ‚Üí 20% weight
   AI Bot Analysis ‚Üí 20% weight
   ```

2. **Fusion Calculation**
   - Weighted confidence averaging
   - Agreement score calculation
   - Source diversity bonus
   - Time synchronization check

3. **Quality Optimization**
   - Historical performance weighting
   - Source reliability adjustments
   - Dynamic weight optimization

4. **Distribution**
   - Tier-based routing
   - Engagement rules application
   - User-specific delivery

## Usage

### Running the Test Demo
```bash
cd /root/HydraX-v2
./test_signal_fusion.py
```

### Starting Live Monitoring
```python
from src.bitten_core.complete_signal_flow_v3 import FusionEnhancedSignalFlow

# Initialize
flow = FusionEnhancedSignalFlow(
    bot_token="YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
    chat_id="YOUR_CHAT_ID"
)

# Start monitoring
await flow.start_monitoring()
```

### Viewing the Dashboard
```python
from src.bitten_core.fusion_dashboard import create_dashboard_app

app, socketio = create_dashboard_app(flow)
socketio.run(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

## Performance Tracking

The system tracks:
- Win rates by confidence tier
- Source reliability scores
- User engagement metrics
- Signal distribution statistics

Performance data is used to:
- Optimize source weights
- Improve tier assignments
- Enhance routing decisions

## Smart Routing Algorithm

### For Nibbler Users (6 signals/day)
1. Only SNIPER and top PRECISION signals
2. Minimum 85% confidence for PRECISION
3. Quality over quantity approach

### For Fang Users (10 signals/day)
1. SNIPER, PRECISION, and top RAPID signals
2. Minimum 75% confidence for RAPID
3. Balanced distribution

### For Commander Users (15 signals/day)
1. Access to all tiers
2. Multi-level take profits
3. Advanced position management

### For Apex Users (20 signals/day)
1. All signals available
2. Shortest time between signals
3. Maximum features enabled

## Integration Points

1. **MT5 Integration**
   - Automated trade execution
   - Risk-based position sizing
   - Multi-level TP management

2. **Telegram Integration**
   - Real-time signal alerts
   - Tier-specific formatting
   - User confirmations

3. **WebApp Integration**
   - Signal detail views
   - Performance tracking
   - User dashboard
