═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

📊 **HEAD-TO-HEAD PERFORMANCE:**
                    APEX v6.0    |    HYPER v1.0
Win Rate:               56.1%    |         0.0%
Signals Tested:       16,236     |           0

🎯 **PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT:**
❌ Win Rate Decline: -56.1% (0.0% vs 56.1%)
📈 Quality vs Quantity: HYPER focuses on fewer, higher-quality signals
🧠 Intelligence Layers: Six-layer filtering system operational

🔍 **HYPER LAYER ANALYSIS:**
• Volume Filter: 88 signals (100.0%)
• Timeframe Filter: 0 signals (0.0%)
• Regime Filter: 0 signals (0.0%)

🌍 **MARKET REGIME PERFORMANCE:**

🏁 **FINAL VERDICT:**
❌ HYPER FAILS - 0.0% vs 56.1%

🎯 **PRODUCTION RECOMMENDATION:**
❌ REVERT TO APEX v6.0 - HYPER needs rebuild

📊 **ANALYSIS:**
HYPER's six-layer intelligence system failed to improve upon APEX v6.0's baseline.
Additional tuning needed to realize the full potential of the intelligence layers.

Intelligence layers operational: ✅ Volume Analysis ✅ Timeframe Alignment ✅ Regime Detection
✅ Dynamic Sizing ✅ Smart Exits ✅ News Filtering

Target achieved: NO (Target: 65%+, Achieved: 0.0%)
