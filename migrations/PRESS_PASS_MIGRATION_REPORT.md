# Press Pass Database Migration Report

## Status: Unable to Execute - Database Server Not Available

### Date: 2025-07-08

## Summary

The Press Pass database migrations are ready to be executed but cannot be run from this environment because:

1. **PostgreSQL is not installed** on this system
2. **No database connection details** are available in the environment
3. The database server (`bitten_db`) appears to be hosted externally

## Migration Files Identified

All required migration files are present in `/root/HydraX-v2/migrations/`:

1. ✓ `add_press_pass_tier_enum.sql` - Adds PRESS_PASS tier to database enums
2. ✓ `press_pass_tables.sql` - Creates core tables for trade logging and analytics  
3. ✓ `press_pass_views.sql` - Creates analytics views and reporting functions
4. ✓ `press_pass_jobs.sql` - Sets up scheduled jobs and automation

## Migration Tracking System

The project has a comprehensive migration tracking system in place:

- **Migration History Table**: Tracks applied migrations to prevent duplicates
- **Shell Script**: `run_press_pass_migrations.sh` provides automated execution
- **SQL Runner**: `run_press_pass_migrations.sql` provides SQL-based execution

## What the Migrations Will Do

### 1. Add PRESS_PASS Tier Enum
- Adds 'PRESS_PASS' to the tierlevel enum type
- Updates CHECK constraints on users, subscription_plans, and trades tables
- Inserts Press Pass subscription plan with these features:
  - Price: $0.00 (free tier)
  - 1 trade per day limit
  - 60% minimum Trading Confidence Score
  - XP resets nightly
  - No advanced features (chaingun, autofire, stealth, etc.)

### 2. Create Press Pass Tables
- `trade_logs_all` - Comprehensive trade logging for all users
- `press_pass_shadow_stats` - Shadow XP tracking that resets nightly
- `conversion_signal_tracker` - Analytics for Press Pass to paid tier conversions
- `press_pass_job_history` - Tracks scheduled job execution

### 3. Create Analytics Views
- `v_press_pass_overview` - User overview with engagement status
- `v_press_pass_daily_metrics` - Daily performance metrics
- `v_conversion_funnel` - Conversion analytics
- `v_press_pass_hot_leads` - Users ready for conversion
- `v_press_pass_trading_patterns` - Trading behavior analysis

### 4. Set Up Scheduled Jobs
- `job_nightly_xp_reset()` - Resets Press Pass XP at midnight UTC
- `job_xp_expiry_warnings()` - Sends XP expiry warnings at 11 PM UTC
- `job_update_engagement_signals()` - Updates engagement metrics every 4 hours

## Required Actions

To complete the Press Pass migration, someone with database access needs to:

### 1. Set Database Connection Variables
```bash
export DB_HOST=<actual_host>
export DB_PORT=5432
export DB_NAME=bitten_db
export DB_USER=bitten_app
export DB_PASSWORD=<actual_password>
```

### 2. Run the Migration Script
```bash
cd /root/HydraX-v2/migrations
./run_press_pass_migrations.sh
```

### 3. Schedule the Cron Jobs
Either using pg_cron or system cron as documented in the README.

### 4. Verify the Migration
Run the verification queries provided in the README to ensure all components were created successfully.

## Security Considerations

- The migration scripts properly use transactions for atomic execution
- Appropriate permissions are granted to the `bitten_app` user
- No sensitive data is exposed in the migration files
- The system includes proper constraints and data validation

## Next Steps

1. **Obtain database connection details** from the system administrator or DevOps team
2. **Execute the migrations** from a system with PostgreSQL client access
3. **Set up the scheduled jobs** for nightly XP resets and analytics updates
4. **Verify the migration** using the provided queries
5. **Monitor the first execution** of scheduled jobs to ensure they run correctly

## Conclusion

The Press Pass migration files are complete and well-structured. They include proper error handling, duplicate prevention, and comprehensive documentation. However, execution requires access to the PostgreSQL database server which is not available in this environment.
