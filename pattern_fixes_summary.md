# Pattern Fixes Applied - September 9, 2025

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. BB_SCALP Pattern (Previously Fixed)
- **Issue**: Using 1.5 SD instead of standard 2.0 SD
- **Issue**: Wrong RSI thresholds (65/35 instead of 70/30)
- **Issue**: Wick requirement too low (40% instead of 60%)
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 2. KALMAN_ARBITRAGE Pattern
- **Issue**: Conflicting Z-score thresholds
  - Line 2560: Skips if |Z| < 1.2
  - Lines 2565-2569: Only signals at |Z| > 2.0
  - Result: Signals between 1.2-2.0 were ignored
- **Fix**: Changed threshold from 2.0 to 1.2 for consistency
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 3. LIQUIDITY_SWEEP_REVERSAL Pattern
- **Issue**: Inconsistent wick requirements
  - Bearish sweep: 60% wick required
  - Bullish sweep: 75% wick required
- **Fix**: Standardized both to 60% for consistency
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

## Patterns Verified Correct
- **ORDER_BLOCK_BOUNCE**: ✅ Using correct thresholds
- **FAIR_VALUE_GAP_FILL**: ✅ Using correct thresholds
- **VCB_BREAKOUT**: ✅ Using correct thresholds
- **SWEEP_AND_RETURN**: ✅ Using correct thresholds
- **MOMENTUM_BURST**: ✅ Using correct thresholds
- **ENGULFING_MOMENTUM**: ✅ Using correct thresholds
- **SCALP_MASTER**: ✅ Using correct thresholds

## Expected Impact
- **KALMAN**: Should generate more signals (1.2-2.0 Z-score range now active)
- **LSR**: More consistent signal generation between buy/sell
- **BB_SCALP**: Better quality signals with proper thresholds
- **Overall**: More balanced signal generation across all patterns

## Next Steps
1. Monitor for 24-48 hours
2. Check win rate improvements
3. Verify signal diversity across patterns
